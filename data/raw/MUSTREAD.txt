In order to replicate the sample gathering from the original dataset. (this step is OPTIONAL).

we used google colab since the original datasets were too big for GitHub.

follow the following steps:-

1. go to notebooks folder
2. choose either sampleGenerator_en or sampleGenerator_es
3. click on "Open in Colab"
4. upload the original csv files for both English and Spanish to your google drive
5. make sure to change the file path in the 4th block with your actual file path
6. run each block inorder

this should generate a small sample containing a total of 2000 movie reviews distributed evenly
between positives and negatives

you can the distribution with the python script in smapleChecker.py.
This will check both English and Spanish
