In order to replicate the sample gathering from the original dataset. (this step is OPTIONAL).

we used google colab since the original datasets were too big for GitHub.

follow the following steps:-

1. go to notebooks folder
2. choose either sampleGenerator_en or sampleGenerator_es
3. click on "Open in Colab"
4. upload the original csv files for either English and Spanish based on 
   your chosen notebook to your google drive
5. make sure to change the file path in the 4th block with your actual 
   file path from your google drive
6. run all blocks

this should generate a csv file with a small sample containing a total of 2000 movie reviews distributed evenly
between positives and negatives

you can check the distribution with the script in sampleChecker.ipynb in notebooks folder
This will check both English and Spanish
