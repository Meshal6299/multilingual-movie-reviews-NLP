feh this movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull the confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so the dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living peoplepusses both the vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad if the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been bettermaybe because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well take on solid human form and most likely start killing off everybody a sort of japanese mystical night of the living dead type thing but this doesnt come to pass even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter no mass rising of the dead no walking army of corpses nothing the priest merely makes the girls spirit go back to the land of the dead taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her as shed crushed his spine like peanut brittleat which point i was tempted to cheer loudly as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the dead girlewwww the robitussen sucking spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time and thats it no real horror no real creepiness which the japanese tend to do far better than american film makers with their emphasis on over the top cheesy face make up no screaming mimis i was very disappointed,negative
crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sidesthe combination of the central character being played by mick malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens and all laughed at the comedyas would be expected of a movie with mick malloy and judith lucy there was quite a bit of swearing but it was not overdone and the audience i sat with certainly enjoyed itmick malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club three times simply to get parking spaces one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membershipjudith lucy does a fine job as his local journalist love interest and there are fabulous performances from bill hunter frank wilson monica maughan lois ramsey and many othersjohn clarkes dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performancethe not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedyim sure that those who enjoyed the castle and the dish would also enjoy this movie,positive
this star studded british spanish co production looks great what you can see of it i have three versions two vhs one dvd and all are terribly cropped so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one as director robert parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once neglecting the middle another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning not in any of the copies i have there are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles one mexican officer is shot shaw and landau celebrating and thats it we never find out why shaw has become a priest if he really is we never find out what happens to don carlos savalas although i suspect he was called home to star in kojak as his departure seems arbitrary and there is a strange flashback sequence where michael craig mysterious island is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old english music hall tradition to the hit battle of new orleans not sung by johnny horton here but with some lyrics ive never heard before on the plus side the location is great a huge old ruined fortress with escher style stairs leading nowhere some nice scenery chewing by robert shaw and good performances by stevens landau lettieri and telly savalas as telly savalas i didnt really like this film but i havent exactly seen it i will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then,negative
my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and cant wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send themof course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are years old and retired but still very active intellectually its great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the showthis series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites spooks and hustle,positive
unfortunately this film is typical of the watering down of a good film by numerous sequels universal made several serial monster films in the s which were pale imitations of the original the intelligent egyptologist imhotep has been replaced by a leg dragging frankenstein in mummy wrappings who exhibits no signs of intelligent life this film is entertaining in spots but if you have seen the mummy you will be disappointed,negative
i loved the apprentice for the first two seasonsbut now with season or is it things are getting just plain too tiringi used to like the show but its become donald trumps own ego fest granted its his company youll be working for but come on some of the things says youre fired is just insultingafter watching the show i would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm good entertainment yes but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack,negative
having seen and loved greg lombardos most recent film knots he co wrote and directed that feature as well i decided to check out his earlier work and this movie was well worth the effort and rental macbeth in manhattan is a tongue in cheek excellent take on the shakespeare favorite updated and moved to nyc i was impressed by the underlying wit and intelligence of the script and was wowed by the way the storyline of the production in the movie mirrors the storyline of the play itself and very cleverly at that the trials and tribulations of life in manhattan parallel many a shakespeare play and central park was rarely put to better use than as the woods around macbeths castle mr lombardo obviously has a fond place in his heart for new york and new york stories knots is a funny and warm sex comedy about six thirty something new yorkers set primarily in a charming brooklyn neighborhood with manhattan offices and a downtown loft thrown in for good measure and has spent considerable time around the plays of shakespeare the movie is well paced and the story reflects a deep understanding of the essential drama at the core of macbeth it reminded me of al pacinos looking for richard another wonderful shakespeare play within a movie i highly recommend checking out macbeth in manhattan,positive
first time i ever felt i needed to write a reviewi have seen thousands of movies in my life and i like a wide range of movies i am reasonably opened minded and can easily say i enjoyed a movie while still saying yeah it was not good but i enjoyed it i can appreciate the mastery of great movies like the shaw shank redemption the godfather and american history x i can like good movies in a genre like horror or comedy even if the movie might not be that great i can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me bloodsport i also will try to rate movie fairly even if i did not like it city lights by charlie chapin was not a movie i enjoyed but i can appreciate the acting and story lines for the timei think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating should take a few ideas into account try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was do not let your personal bias affect the rating also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to ratethis movie was the worst piece of trash i have ever seen hours of my life where just stolen the acting was awful across the board the scenes where choppy at best however the real disgrace was the story the first minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point a to b however after that it was a nightmare they kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained nothing really ever made sense was steward dead is he alive did he hit by lighting was it really lighting was it aliens is he an alien etc the ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions the only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater what is wrong with some of you i will admit that the of us where so mad about seeing this we did think what would make it better and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie what can i say misery loves company that is really the only reason i can see for a ratingdo not waste your life,negative
its been said that batman begins in the first batman movie to get it right but i think thats a horrible overstatement for i think the new batman film although greater that batman forever and batman and robin pales compared to tim burtons classics with this one being the best of the five the darkness is beautiful as is the music and scenery creating a gotham city cloaked in mystery unlike batman begins where gotham city is a normal looking city the villains are terrific in this movie you literally cant take your eyes off of the penguin and cat woman i applaud tim burton for being original with his use of the penguin as a freak rather than an ordinary criminal or a clone of the old batman tv show in batman begins we have the scarecrow whose not nearly as demanding on screen as the penguin or cat woman the film doesnt need to focus only on batman because we already know his story and it is the villains who we are exploring and trying to figure out and they are the ones who create the plot with the penguin running for mayor and seeking revenge for his parents desertion by killing the first born sons of gotham a task he fails danny devito gives the finest performance ever by a superhero villain in any film surpassing even nicholsons joker the closing scene where the penguins drag the dead body of the penguin into the water is touching and powerful its a tragedy that tim burton wasnt allowed to complete his trilogy since warner bros interesting in marketing appeal wanted to lighten the batman movies up and they got their wishunfortunately tim burton planned on directing the third film using the riddler as the villain with no two face and robin to mess it up and im sure michael keaton wouldve signed on so this is the last great batman film batman begins is dark but boring tedious ordinary filled with lackluster villains and a playboy bruce wayne a decent batman film but the best batman film ever never batman returns holds that crown,positive
when uwe boll cinema con man extraordinaire released the first house of the dead adaptation to completely deserved mockery it was generally agreed among fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to contemplate making a sequel hollywoods per capita ratio of morons must indeed be high for not only do we have a sequel it was distributed in the antipodes by sony a company not normally known for its taste in expensive write offs released direct to television in america the sequel does improve on the original in most respects but in so doing it becomes bland rather than interesting the scale of the scenario is enlarged with the action taking place in a deserted town that just happens to surround a university where experiments in a virus that can reanimate the dead have been occurring in particular the action is spread throughout the university where the first infected denizens can be found put simply the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs within a house where dead people can be foundthe cast on the other hand is a real step backward emmanuelle vaugier was specifically made up to resemble a low rent angelina jolie while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming it jürgen prochnow in fact the only name that will stand out among this cast is one sticky fingaz who probably did not want to be recognised that easily by the people he faces at home put simply these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen even under the best direction say what you will about boll but he at least inspired actors like ona grauer to fight against his ineptitude that said the people involved here at least seem to be aware that their film sucks and that they might as well have some fun with it much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was crafting some kind of misunderstood masterpiece and he took himself seriously unfortunately with the actors failing to take their characters or the predicament seriously what little dramatic tension there could have been is underminedmuch of the plot concerns itself with the search for a generation zero victim of whatever plague is causing the dead to rise or to translate into more practical terms they are trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that was threatening to humans how this would help when a non mutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine is anyones guess but the manner in which this quest is paced out suffers problems of its own the we have to go back plot device is used in order to pad out the running time but the actual timing of the extra quest is also problematic we are told at one point that the town will be obliterated by cruise missiles in ten minutes yet the heroes drive back into the university locate the sample they are looking for and fight off enough zombies to eat the army of china all in this space of time filmmakers take note it only pays to be specific with time when it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tensionthe special effects used in house of the dead leave those of the original in the dust where uwe boll simulated the deaths of the characters using idiotic rotating camera tricks michael hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow necks are bitten arms are cut off heads are shot it all makes for a much more convincing throughput but it also disallows the mockery of obvious fakery the photography is also much improved as dvd crypt put it the fact that it is in focus throughout makes it an improvement upon the original but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of the writing is also both an improvement and a setback throughout the script references to other horror and survival horror games the most obvious being run like hell are offered the first couple of times they work because they offer clever ways to work titles into ordinary everyday dialogue after the eighth time however they just get on the nerves because they remind gamers of things they would prefer to do with their timeinterestingly house of the dead cost a mere six million to bring to television screens across america given that tom savini on his own would cost more than this to work on a film nowadays i have to say i am somewhat impressed with the visual results in contrast to the much reviled original the zombies here look like actual zombies rather than extras in bad makeup shot poorly in a further contrast to the original the actors appear to have a clue what they are doing sealing the deal is the fact that apart from some real zingers scattered throughout the characters speak like real people however the story is nothing that we have not seen a thousand times already when aliens the real dawn of the dead or the evil dead were released to acclaim the acclaim came from the fact that these films either did something we had not seen before or did it so well that we did not really care house of the dead is competent enough that we do not mock it but it brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table so we end up not caring eitherfor that reason and many others i gave house of the dead a two out of ten it is too good to be bad but too bad to be any good unless you are into sucky films as much as i am you are best to steer clear of it,negative
i was or years old at the time and living in salt lake city utah and i still remember the new dome theater called the century layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater we felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film ta da da daa da ta da dada dada i can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals i loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas i know peter finch and luv and sally had some trouble with the lip sink but hey this was a feel good go feel better about things film what i regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it showed the cut version and then called it a flop i saw the cut version and i can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition yes i wince a bit at peters effort to make love through music but you know i didnt see it that way when i left the theater when they surveyed us as we left i regret any comment i made that may have altered the original i liked it then and still see it while i listen to the music on my lp most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and i can use the films monologues in our games of what movie is this i wish a directors cut on dvd was available it is available on vhs but its not quite the same i would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins struggles and triumphs picky people should leave things well enough alone bring it back,positive
after seeing midnight offerings i am still convinced that the first decent movie about teenage witches yet has to be made i didnt think much of the craft and im not into charmed either the only film i more or less enjoyed about teenage witches was little witches and even that one wasnt very good but changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies you will also enjoy midnight offeringsi was expecting a silly and cheesy early s movie about teenage witches in high school but i was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious the acting is decent and serious all the time no jokes are being played by teenagers or something and the musical score at first i thought was pretty good it added some scariness and also something classy with the use of threatening violins and all but as the movie progressed i came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious they didnt have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speedthen theres melissa sue anderson who was the main reason for me to see this movie a few weeks ago i saw her in happy birthday to me a rather enjoyable thick plotted and goofy on some occasions slasher movie which she had done in the same year as midnight offerings and i must say she was very good as the icy cold bad witch vivian but the main problem with the movie is almost nothing happens vivian causes a death and an accident yes but thats it then theres robin the good witch who is just learning about her powers and we expect the two of them using their powers more than once but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles that was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches and whats worse i was hoping to see a spectacular show down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects flaming eyes or whatever but nothing happens there is sort of a confrontation in the end but its a big disappointmentso the acting of the two witches was good the musical score was decent even though overly ambitious and the cinematography was rather dark and moody at times but that doesnt make a good movie yet does it,negative
in a word this film was boring it lacked life and spark a big problem is with the two leads jude law and gwyneth paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever he was boring and she was annoying the visuals were interesting but they didnt enhance the scenes if anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen none of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of dangerthe film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director i kept thinking during the film you know this movie wouldve worked if harrison ford was sky captain karen allen was polly and steven spielberg was the director ignore the critical acclaims for this film the critics i think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels,negative
most of this film is an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on nazism and fascism made at the height of those movements successsadly in the final moments of the film chaplin abandons all pretense of making art not to mention comedy and switches completely to propaganda and not anti nazi propaganda either but some of the most mawkish and idiotic progressive propaganda ever to ooze out of hollywoodnever mind that nothing we have seen so far indicates that the barber is even capable of giving the speech we see him give delivered ironically with a disturbing wild eyed fanaticism such trivialities must not be permitted to interfere with the message,positive
id have to say this is one of the best animated films ive ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this moviea gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening minute scene with scat is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him sid the sloth voiced by john leguizano however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movieray romano is the voice of the mammoth the big character of the film literally while denis leary is the ferocious bad guy turned good sabertooth tigerthis isnt just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters this isnt interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive language wiseif more animated movies were this good id own more,positive
in the year keep in mind this is two years ago not four two men had the motivation to create the most miraculous piece of art on this side of the mississippithanks to jere cunningham and tom flynn the world can now enjoy second string a delicious tv movie depicting a tale of a rag tag gang of second stringers thus the title who are thrust into the position of starters due to an order of bad oystersbecause of the motivational direction of both the director robert lieberman and the buffalo bills last minute qb dan give em hell heller portrayed by canadian actor gil bellows the oft super bowl snake bitten bills find themselves in the ultimate positionwith an intriguing mix of internal and external conflict a love story comraderie that only the fine sport of football can bring and an overall theory that the underdog can compete second string is an excellent movie worthy of viewing every possible moment that it appears on tntthe only thing potentially bad about this production is the spelling of the costume designers first name jenifur jarvis,positive
while i had wanted to se this film since the first time i watched the trailer i was in for a deep surprise with this film while some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing most kids wont understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults i was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts the musical score was once again solid proving hans zimmer is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and i never thought i would say i actually enjoyed brian adams music,positive
lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch garfields gritty breakthrough performance introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the brandos and clifts and so on after the war but all that sisterly affection is a bit suffocating priscilla lane is a bright engaging performer but the other sisters dont really register though theyre all allowed to be tart and witty and i just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides garfield jeffrey lynn is a pleasant enough actor but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with garfields hard luck mickey borden and that throws the film a bit out of whack imagine a jimmy stewart or someone in the part also i was not convinced that garfield would make the pivotal to say the least final decision that he made the film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action it feels awfully rushed and under motivatedstill its not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it fondly it falls short of being a classic but it does contain a few classic moments the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic,positive
this movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses gabriels horn to open heaven and pull the good angel dogs out and imprision them on alkatraz the devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joys of being bad and at one point eats a live ratwe got this movie free with a pizza you get what you pay for,negative
i was excited at the concept of my favorite comic book hero being on television and sorely disappointed at the end resultthe only amazing thing was the wall crawling despite the visibility of the cable i didnt think nick hammond was peter parker and he was visibly of a different build than the guy who did the stunts in the spider suit you could tell they were two different actorsgranted i can also spot in the modern spider man movies when i am looking at tobey macguire and when i am looking at cgi but that is from a trained eye and experience working with cgi still the s version could have been better despite lack of special fxthe webs were hokey and looked like ropes that seemed to wrap around things rather than stick to them and what was up with giving him a spider mobile to ride around in hello hes the web slinger peoplesorry didnt mean to get so worked up but our beloved wall crawler deserved better,negative
although i am very familiar with poet dylan thomas i know nothing of his life whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved i would imagine that the edge of love based on the novel manipulates things a bit but unless you are a historian or a poet who caresthe movie is less about thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life one is his wife kathrine and the other is vera who was his first love one romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot now grown up they are good friends i forgot to mention that this is set during the war vera becomes engaged to captain will killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war while he is away vera starts to fall for thomas again and kathrine has fallen out of love with him she is also carrying another mans child things get even more emotionally complex when capt killig returnsas you can see it is a very soap operatic plot and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue but all is not lost yet for a non hollywood production i think that the edge of love is about as stylish a picture as one can get it is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about of contemporary romances hollywood production or not some of it has to do with being set during the war which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial a bit like atonement this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to joe wrights oscar nominee but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression things are okay at the start and finish but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story i doubt if the edge of love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer but is a good film to check it might even make a good date night movie considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today,positive
if only the writer producer star had the slightest inkling of the limits of his acting range and the way he is perceived on screen wearing glasses and a side parting is not enough to make you look gawky and quirky if your face and teeth have been sculpted by various medical professionals to conform to american ideals of generic characterless symmetry erroneously perceived as beauty in this obsessively superficial society he would have cast john heder as the main character instead of attempting to pull a good will hunting and create a vehicle to showcase his his well himselfthe excellent supporting cast lord knows they must be having problems to agree to this is wasted in an agonising perpetual struggle to react convincingly to a main character incapable of delivering even the simplest line with appropriate intonation and believe me he is not short of simple lines to choose from as the dialogue appears to have been composed by a five year old ah wait its the same person pretending to be a writer as pretending to be an actor its not often that i dont see a film through to the end but this ejaculation was irredeemable from the outset and showed no signs of improving after the first hour excrement,negative
the most enjoyable parts of this film were the clips from the original movie the acting was poor and the premise of sexual scorecards was revolting the effects were marginal at best there were no stand out performances amy irving was put in this film to try and get a part of the halloween h audience the original was much more enjoyable and gratifying i am sorry to say that this is not going to be one of the years bestso far it is at the bottom of my list dont bother with this one folks,negative
i had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well i wondered if i had read the wrong reviews please a boy meets girl next door at and both aspire to love and being basketball legends grow apart but watch each others progress guess what both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies and guess what is picked up by lakers dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period so for years they go their own way she returns from spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout he wins he marries she wins he loves her well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl the end has her playing basketball and he has baby duties sorry is my high score my partner she scored for a soapy story for those who read mills and boon,negative
i struggle to see the point of this movie it is supposed to be a comedy but i didnt laugh once the storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie but since this is acted by comics the result is totally unbelievable as comedies should be the comic strip series was very hit and miss even withing the episodes and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things one to avoid i have also just found out that comments have to be lines long the whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart if you like seinfeld larry sanders the young ones alan partridge arrested development curb red dwarf then you might like to pass on this on the other hand if you like lame jokes such as can be found in friends and dodgeball enjoy watching this,negative
as this movie unfolds you start to feel the conundrum of human existence if you carry with you questions inner wars unsolved puzzles about the meaning of life then you will feel this movie with every morsel of your body charles darwin begins a war with an utterly predictable ending war with god his theories resemble the fact that god has nothing to do with mankind has nothing to do with the amazing world that we live in savage harsh ironic and chaotic this words surround the mind of the character thrown into an universe of material truth who slowly pushes hope for god out from his mind nevertheless the movie as charles darwin still sees wonder and beauty beyond god in the universe of infinite evolution,positive
maybe the target audience of this disney channel tv movie will be pleased with it but if any parents are watching along with the youngsters they will clearly see that cranked out is written all over this production obviously it was no ones dream to make this movie but rather this was concocted in a board room somewhere then produced with cold efficiency there is some talent among the cast but actors like dabney coleman and jay thomas dont get much of a chance to showcase their talent the impossibly cute elisabeth harnois is engaging as the first daughter but will friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character though hes not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his boy meets world role the background for this movie is washington dc and the white house but there is no real presidential feel to the film and the secret service is made out to be little better than the keystone kops when it come to doing their duty the disney channel presents a lot of original tv movies and most of them are better than this,negative
this film could well have been one of those ordinary soapies relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined broken relationshipsbuilding new friendships street bashings near accidents hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes what a mixture of eventsfortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers he asks in this chaotic world do things just happen is it just luck when things turn out right or taking a fatalistic view is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective most of us have had this uncanny experienceis it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important as one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the grand canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he wasthis is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships danny glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role,positive

and i for one think that is a good thing ive just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making thisas for the rest of the production i think it was slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails on the blackboard voice belting out hey it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah and although i missed it i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copyi also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the moviesi think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the th time you hear it,positive
jeff wincott is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves ive seen in a very long time ok so maybe bridgette nielson isnt the first person id hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job nontheless and lets not forget that wincott has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert stuntwoman karen sheperd so shes not cynthia rothrock who cares shes just as good if not better just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word ouch my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you havent seen it youre really missing out on some great martial arts action,positive
i watch them allits not better than the amazing ones strictly ballroom shall we dance japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsi am an english teacher and i find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting for example the name should scream dont watch how she move since when can movie titles ignore grammar there is nothing inherently incorrect about caribbean english grammar its just not canadian standard english grammar comments about the dialogue seem off to me i put on the subtitles because im a canadian standard english speaker so i just automatically assumed that i would have trouble understanding all of it it wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies i have seen were so americani loved that this movie was set in toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there i loved that the heroine was so atypically cast i enjoyed the stepping routines i liked the driven mum character i felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesin summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one if you have superiority issues about the grammar of the english standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie,positive
richard brooks excellent film of truman capotes novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour hoffmans oscar winning performance in the capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made years apart that mesh so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick hickock the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote id suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience,positive
deeply emotional it cant leave you neutralyes its a love story between years old boys but its only the body of this movie and its been removed you only feel what happened with these boys you feel the soul of the movie with of course some action some sex but this is no pornography too many feelingsit was only a summer story and it became from love to hate almost to death the most important time of their lives i loved it you will too whatever your feelings are,positive
there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and its drivel on satellite re runs nowit might fool you because it has moderately well known names in kistofferson and henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice monument valley sceneryit also has some curly haired woman who fights a lotif thats all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happyits still drivel though,negative
i enjoyed this movie havent seen andy griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly ive associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that hes versatilei wasnt troubled that dottys anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook there are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms she is clearly a sensitive with extra sensory powers as was understood by the local indians but not by any anglos it is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentricalthough this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems also hirams twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle its fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance,positive
first off the movie was not true to facts at all i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasnt anything like it first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it in my opinion russell crowe didnt fit to this part at all since he doesnt look the intelligent individualist type therefore he really couldnt play one it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics similar to pi and not the over dramatized lovelife at this level abm was too hollywood ish and too superficial to be great personally i think he wasnt mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we lesser mortals,negative
the documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that muslims are trying to violently take over the world then states that any muslim that doesnt admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle east i would look elsewhere try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources,negative

before i comment about this movie you should realize that when i saw this movie i expected the typical crap horror b movie and just wanted to have fun jack frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that ive seen in a long time scott mcdonald is great as jack frost in fact i think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance mcdonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements as soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people though you will find it hard not to laugh the lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny the fact that the rest of the cast completely over acts just adds to stupidity of the film but its stupidity is its genius the scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in b movie horror film fashion i truly hope there is a sequel and ill be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it of course its only fun to watch the first few times and its not exactly a good work of motion picture technology but i just like to see snowmen kill people i gave it a out of this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours,positive

this movie had an excellent premise and could have been a fascinating look at racism attitudes to women at work and male female relations in england early last century however it simply turned into a soppy love story but what was worse is that the love story was totally unbelievable the acting was for the most part poor the direction confusing but most of all the screenplay and the story were non existent the only thing i liked about the film was how dark it must have been before electric lighting i really got a sense of just how little light one candle puts out,negative
its a genuine shame that this spin off tv series inspired by the superior made for tv pictures the night stalker and the night strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl kolchaks spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the sentry and horror in the heights plus you cant go wrong with such triedntrue fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn john fiedler john dehner severn darden and william daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewer set climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest small time chicago illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchakkolchak was the quintessential s everyman protagonist a wily and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon oakland was perfect as carls chronically ill tempered boss tony vincenzo jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular lycanthrope in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in chopper cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in the youth killer but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the programs trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavins boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence,positive
i consider myself lucky that i got to view a wonderful movie with two marvelous actors kramer vs kramer was great to me because i think i could relate to itunfortunately my parents are divorced even though i was older than billy in this movie i felt his pain and confusion having two parents who you thought were happy and end up hating each other is the worst through this movie actually i think it made me realize that my parents are people too and they had as just much pain as my sister and i hadback to the movie this was a good one yes its dated and meryl and dustin are very young but i would recommend this for a lot of people because i think most can relate in some way there are funny sad happy and relieving moments that are carried away terrificly by these great actors its a good movie and deserves more credit than a,positive
you cant exactly shove her out of the way because shes old and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with isnt really her fault nevertheless in these circumstances its often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake so it is with the pallbearer an attempt to do something different with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong sort of like showing off your breakdancing skills at a grandparents funeralto further extend the metaphor perhaps unwisely like the old lady one starts to feel with the set up of the film that its demise cannot be far away sure enough this particular death is agonizingly protracted slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction downhill its laboured attempts at humour can be seen coming a mile off again not unlike the grim inevitability of deathreturning once again to the image of dragging heels the main character tom is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life if there are indeed degrees of pathetic then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of schwimmers other more famous role to find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even more clueless than ross is certainly a tough ask even for as able a comic performer as schwimmer but i guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously echoing situations in the first placehow will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if hes picking scripts where the characters could almost be interchangeable even if the situations arent a man with a longstanding high school crush on someone he hasnt seen for years sound familiar paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her rachel role but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable differences present werent so incongruous as well unfortunately the romantic element is so well worn its threadbare and the backdrop is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a stiff,negative
spheeris debut must be one of the best music documentaries of all time and as far as i know its also the only one that focuses on the la punk explosion of the early eighties its all there not just great great bands like black flag fear x the germs whose names may not mean much to you today but whose influence on todays alternative rock music can not be over estimated but also the promoters the media and first of all the audiences the punks all portrayed in a manner that makes you laugh shudder and gasp with astonishment about the energy the anger and the fury these youths put into their music where is that today the eighties may have sucked big time when it cames to mainstream music but the underground was rocking if you need a proof for that watch fears performance in decline unmatched great film how come this is not available on vid ld or dvd ps the follow up decline pt ii is hilarious too,positive
i suppose this movie is not your typical spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad the movie is based in the real story of french man jean claude romand and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film in the real story of mr romand the family didnt escape after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife two children parents and dog and although he tried to kill himself it seems he didnt try very hard as he survived i watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected i was laughing as i had read the book about mr romand and knew it did happen i like josé coronado in this movie he offered us a good performance as the rest of the crew,positive
note after writing this review i see that this listing is indeed about the tv series and not the original film my mistake i thought imdb for a database for movies not tv shows but since most people will look up this film under bagdad cafe and not out of rosenheim which strangely is the name this film is listed under on imdb ill leave this comment heremaybe i missed something but when i read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the cbs series which must have been loosely based on this film i did not see the tv series and i might like it or not but one thing i am sure is that it is very different than this film this film is not like a tv show at all and whoopie goldberg is not in it or any other famous hollywood stars other than jack palance who was very charming in his rolethis is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box it is not at all like a hollywood formula movie which is probably why the whats a nice word for idiots who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this onefirst of all this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get go from the music which is just part of the time so you cant really call it a musical to the cinematography to the really cool storya german or bavarian woman very pretty and quite plump gets in an argument with the other german or bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the california desert with and parts ways with him he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert like highway out in the middle of nowhereshe finds the small and dilapidated but charming bagdad cafe in bagdad california and checks in the rest of the story is magic i dont want to try to describe this film because i want you to enjoy every surprisewarning if you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involvedi gave this film a for orginality entertainment and sheer delightfulness,positive
although copies of this movie are hard to find if you can find it get it i believe this was aside from in the navy abbott and costellos only musical although they twisted the plot around a little ive never heard a version where the butcher goes up with him you still enjoy the antics of the slightly idiotic but lovable jack and the greedy butcher mr dinklepuss slightly reminiscent of dubarry was a lady this uproarious film will have you rolling on the floor only to get up and dance as lou costello sings i dont know why they didnt do that in other films,positive
this could have been a very good film if i had been able to watch it the hand held camera was very bouncy from the opening credits i was worried several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end but we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film giving some insight to the young pop culture in south africa the black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it the acting seemed very authentic some of the dialog was a little hard to understand but a theater full of non south africans seemed to find most of it funny if you get motion sickness at all though you may seriously consider skipping this film its quaint but not worth the nausea,negative

freddys dead the final nightmare was the last film to feature freddy krueger as a solo act not as an entity or a co star the years of killing have taken a toll upon the town of springwood it has gotten to the point that the little city has become a virtual ghost town the parents who killed freddy krueger so many years ago have all paid the ultimate price only the mad inhabit the town and the survivors are scattered everywhere but that doesnt stop freddy from seeking out his final revenge no matter how they try to stop him he always comes back for more but this time he finds out a little more about his old life can the kids finally stop freddy for good what is this secret that is buried in freddys twisted mind to find out youll have to watch freddys dead the end was originally filmed in da fitting way to end the franchise freddy learns something about himself and his perverted life and he gets to go out in a bang lisa zane yaphet kotto and freddy krueger star in this final installment rosanne tom arnold and johnny depp make special appearances a whole lot better than the last one but its filled with a few dated jokes if you enjoy the series then you dont want to miss out on this onei have to recommend this movie for freddy fans,positive
kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness the plot is so contrived and unbelievable starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more peopleincluding clergy involved in what is a crime everywhere next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces a very unpleasant and coo coo mother aided abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends moving the setting from an island off the coast of south carolina did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget the very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service kim basinger whom i do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads i thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all the movie i kept surfing back and forth to had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much unless you like an unbelievable story wooden acting a contorted mixture of religious mythological allegory my advice is to skip this one oh and maybe a small carping criticism but wouldnt a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat the best part of this movie is the scenery,negative
i loved this movie im a mexican and was in the least offended by it in fact i think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over mexico its a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a month old corpse it angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells we should have someone like creasy denzel washingtons character a bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities i actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the ones creasy did his fine job upon that would be so marvelous sorry i am that resentful man on fire is a gripping film that you cant miss it might be hard on some of you if you arent used to reading subtitles mexicans do that all the time while watching american movies but the effort will be well worth it some of the editing is a bit fuzzykind of like traffic remember another brilliant take on how corrupt mexico is the movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half i swear youll be cheering as you watch denzel washington dispatch the wrong doers his performance is nothing short of excellent the ending no spoilers ok is a bit sad but im sure youll like it anyway man on fire is one of the years best movies a must own for a dvd collection out of,positive

this proved to be a rare case of a poliziottesco made with british funding unfortunately the result is undistinguished except by its exceeding unpleasantness and borderline camp approach despite stars and director the former is led by a wooden franco nero and an ultra hammy telly savalas as a couple of would be robbers if anyone is able to believe either actor who generally exude cool as a duo of bumbling crooks hes more gullible than i amtheir job goes awry ending in murder and saddled with cases of cutlery instead of jewels however the mismatched criminals see an opening to their dilemma when they inadvertently kidnap the son of a british diplomat a miscast lester who even gets to kick trigger happy savalas where it hurts at one point still they never actually ransom him and their sole intent is to cross the border into france tagging along with them is neros girlfriend a wasted ely galleani soon enough though shes had enough and decides to run away while the others are sleeping the crazy savalas notices this and following the girl kills her in the meantime nero and lester have woken up the former thinks his accomplices may have double crossed him so he goes on the lam with the boy in tow after a brief spell at a rich old ladys country estate which features totally gratuitous rear nudes by both nero and lester savalas catches up with them they continue their trek where the trio run into a family of german campers the situation degenerates to the point where savalas shuts them inside their trailer and tosses the lot into the river though hes badly hurt in the process himself typically it all ends with the heavies getting killed just as theyre about to reach the borderthe film therefore contains most of the genres typical elements sleaze sadism violence chases the aftermath of the opening robbery when the getaway car causes havoc in the citys narrow back streets and even disrupts a funeral procession is downright farcical etc one mildly interesting aspect to it is that by the end lester himself is seen to have been definitely irrevocably marked by the experience coming to feel excitement when an act of violence is committed,negative
i wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film the only reason why i didnt rate it for awful was due to the great talent of carmen miranda the beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancingthe problem is with the rest of the picture alice faye comes off quite hollow don ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material he comes off so terribly cornythe plot is a real stiff here with ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to fayeit seems that by playing the song and dance man ameches marriage gets a second change to reignite some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both partssz sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine ditto for j carrol naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his rolethis is a chica chica boom bomb of a film,negative
we all know that countless duds have graced the s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust maybe thats a bit hastey but damn if slaughter high wasnt terribly unoriginal even for a slasher flick pretty much the plot involves a kid who experienced a carrie like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former bullies who all show up to reminisce as youd expect they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on april st by means of electrocution burning hanging and chemically altered beer ive got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie but considering the ending i feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time ignore any thought of viewing this movie,negative

police squad was a funny show that ended too soon but i guess it had its run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many american television shows the geniuses behind this funny show were the team of zucker abrahams and zucker every since his straight act in the comedy hit airplane leslie nielsen has found a new career as a comedian in this short lived tv series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more the bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending but lt drebrin leslie nielsen got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believedtooo bad they never released this on dvd if a show needed to be re released it would have to be this one a whole new generation is waiting to see this showhighly recommended,positive
may i please have my back i would have rather watched hydro electric power comes to north america again this is a movie with one voice the same voice which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender to listen to that voice again i would have to charge at least an hour and i dont take insurance it was eerie watching will ferrell morph into woody but i dont think imaginative casting is enough one should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie unless hes just doing it for the money and if thats the case why not just reissue an all rap version of whats up tiger lily,negative

that separate good memorable movies from movies like this its not entertaining touching funny interesting and at times feels a little sub human the principals act like they are other worldly in the worse way when they are supposed to be relating to each other and the audience starts out conventionally enough rich kid gets new car for graduation but the dean says he cant have the car until after the ceremony goes joy riding nonetheless and stops in the diner on the wrong side of the tracks for a quick argument with the local yokels wise asses the waitress girlfriend of the head yokel shockingly they play chicken until they accidentally burn down the diner they left three minutes earlier arent all diners five feet from the gas stationthey told they have to pay the price in court so the only reason to get this fish out of water to stay in town is to come up with the scenario that both boys have to assist in the rebuilding of the diner worse than that the rich kid in staying with the family of the un rich kidin the room above the attic that room above the attic has rescued many a person in need of a bedrich kid inexplicably is treated well by the girlfriend who never mentions to him that he nearly killed her this does not bode well of course with her boyfriend and is never fully explained you dont know why sam leelee sobieski falls for kelley chris klein or why jasper josh hartnett allows it chris klein is tolerable leelee completely intolerable and josh does not register much of an impression the character with the most life is the judge that sentences kelley and jasper to help re build the diner she gets off at least one funny remark which is more than anyone else does everyone is so morose and humorless that you will feel a little sill if you even think of smiling while the movie is on the ending is one way to end the piece not the most original but at least it was over i dont enjoy trashing a movie that some little girl somewhere in the world might really love but since i am not one i have to the nicest thing i can say about this movie is that its not mean spirited and although it fails to compel its innocence and home spun corny dialogue comes from a nice place,negative
after a day at work i sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels the movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so i tuned in just before it started the first minutes were enough to make me interested but the lack of acting ability in jamie foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie if there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to david morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting all in all dont plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night,negative
five fingers relies heavily on barbaric shock value hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie going response this is where this movie fails throughout primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously i was repulsed and disgusted that five fingers was even made and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it torture in and of itself is gruesome even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome but obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough it had to go way beyond what was needed and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point for this reason this movie came across as nothing more than being self gratifying five fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a b movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time in other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets this is a little bit of a twist of the normal hollywood manipulation of time whereas the viewer normally is shown page in a page script as the beginning of the movie and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending five fingers is dedicated to flashing back which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie overall five fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie because torture is obviously obscene and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point i am surprised that dick cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero this movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy mindless dolts,negative
illuminata has expanded the limits of john turturros mediocrity from second rate actor to third rate director writer and producer this film was dreadful it is disjointed and flits from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the main story linewe are served with a smorgasbord of fragmented scenes each a non sequitur to all the others the only thread that seems to run through them is that they occur in the lives of the members of the same theatre repertory company the few scenes that do matter to the plot are so convoluted that you frequently cant tell if the dialogue is from the story or the actors running their lines for the play within the story if this story were a person it would be a schizophrenic with mulitple personality disorder it couldnt decide if it was a drama a romance a comedy a tragedy a sex farce or a parody of theatre it came closest to being bearable as a sex farce turturro was lifeless and impassive as tuccio supposedly a complex and passionate writer whose play gets its big chance when the currently running show needs to be cancelled due to the illness of the lead actor susan sarandon gave a good performance as the aging actress trying to seduce tuccio for a role unfortunately she found it necessary to go topless which only goes to illustrate that the hardware of aging sex symbols is much better left to the imagination christoher walkin gave a delightful performance as the uppity theatre critic who makes impassioned overtures to a member of the cast beverly dangelo and ben gazzara also had minor rolesi gave this film a other than walkens vignette there is really not much to recommend it except that the puppets used in the opening and closing credits were phenomenally lifelike and beautiful avoid this movie like the plague that it is,negative
harry langdons saturday afternoon is often ranked among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keatons cops or chaplins the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesnt offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether langdon belongs in such rarefied company nonetheless in my opinion its a perfectly charming comedy in its minor key way and harry is fascinating to watchfor a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the honeymooners or its many spin offs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wifes thumb try to sneak out with a couple of good time girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already shopworn when this film was made but beyond that nothing about langdon was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middle aged baby who was half asleep any freudians who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this timid pudgy faced baby man and his stern gently domineering mommy wife when harry tries to hide money under the rug but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over youd swear youre watching an interaction between a year old boy and his mama and maybe thats why harry langdon gave some people the creeps and still doesbut hes a compelling screen figure and its not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the coins under the rug for instance harry finds the coins by placing one foot before the other carefully like a tightrope walker counting off his paces until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic langdon moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big fistfight is taking place harrys co star vernon dent is in the thick of the action but harry is in a daze for much of the time and winds up sort of punch drunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets its a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it encapsulates langdons screen persona quite perfectly hes a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action blinking sleepily while the world rushes past its also worth noting that langdon and dent who worked together frequently have a rapport in this movie that suggests a blueprint laurel hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later langdons style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially heresaturday afternnon and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that langdon makes an impression thats hard to shake,positive
this was by far one of the worst movies sandra bullock has starred in ben affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts this is definitely his forte and acting is not i actually lasted minutes into this movie before i was so bored with it i felt compelled to leave the theater its a bore from beginning to well minutes into the film anyway the premise of guess what happened to me on the way to the has been done over and over to death somehow there just doesnt seem to be anything funny or romantic about people cheating on each other parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage children especially impressionable ones that may view sandra as a hero there is a scene where the writers producers directors thought it would be nice to show how acceptable it is to smoke a joint while driving and then have no consequences at all when caught im no prude and i smoked my share when i was younger but i guarantee you i wont take my teenagers to see it and theyre solid a b students if you want to see a good sandra bullock movie rent the net or hope floats which i believe are two of her best works,negative
amazing movie i saw this movie for the first time on a flight and could not believe that i had not even heard of it before getting on that plane while it may seem at first to be a chick flick it is a film that everyone should see and will enjoy men watch this movie with someone you love you will enjoy it as much as she does and it will score you big points,positive
well shuck me sideways i havent seen a home movie this bad since the abysmal seconds or half caste someone should take away this guys sony handycam this movie proves that just because you can make a movie on your camcorder for doesnt necessarily mean you shouldi remember that one of the things that robert rodriguez wrote in his book rebel without a crew was that when you set out to make a no budget feature you have to use whatever assets you have at your disposal rodriguez says that you should take an inventory of all the locations and props that you can beg steal and borrow from your friends robert rodriquez was friends with the mayor of some town in mexico so the mayor let him shoot all over for free what you got in el mariachi was a movie that looked like it cost much more than the actual budgetim sure that the director of this movie has a copy of that book and he took that advice to heart in this case he was apparently friends with a guy who owned a cornfield where they put on a haunted house every year seems like a pretty good location for a scary movie but its hard to keep a cornfield interesting for minutes not a single installment of the children of the corn series spent more than a few minutes in the cornfield hitchcock only spent about ten minutes in one in north by northwest take a hint fella cornfields dont make for riveting cinema it would have been good if the director would have had more friends with more locations because this thing gets pretty tedious after the first minutes this movie looks like it cost about or whatever it cost in admission to the cornfield mazeapparently he couldnt even find anyone to act in his movie so he cast himself big mistake heres a thought if you really want to make a movie get an actor so as far as assets go it seems like the cornfield maze is the only thing the poor guy had maybe he thought that was enough in fact im going to go out on a limb and say that i know he thought that was enough because the movie before it captured the coveted honor of being the sequel to dark harvest was called simply the maize the movie maybe this hes already planning the maize the musical or even the maize the mini seriesour jack of all trades and yes the master of nothing part of that saying is definitely appropriate here plays a psychic dad who can tell when bad things are going to happen think of the character from the dead zone but not anywhere near as good an actor as christopher walken or even anthony michael hall psychic dad has a premonition that his two daughters who are at the corn maze with mom are going to be killed he rushes to save them from that point on the whole movie is spent watching pyschic dad run around in a cornfield looking for his two daughters he finds the two little girl ghosts from the shining and he helps solve the mystery of their murdershot on a handycam the director cast himself edited on imovie improvised story if thats not enough to keep you away from this a maize ingly corny catastrophe consider this as a final warning the whole movie takes place in a cornfield boils and ghouls heres ghoulie gurus tip on how to save some money and still feel like youve seen this movie next time you see a cornfield stop the car take a flashlight and go run around in there for like minutes,negative
i bought the dvd version of this movie on the recommendation of my wife who loved the version she saw aired in television but the version put to dvd was a disaster the lighting was poor to non existent and entire scenes were simply excised in one instance adele is being put to bed and we immediately cut to another scene coming in in mid sentence where its the next night characters such as grace poole and mason are never even introduced leaving one to wonder if theyd dozed off for a few minutes during the moviethe dvd we saw was produced by platinum disc corp and even at it was a gypbe careful which version of this movie you buy were sending this one back,negative
this is the best work i have ever seen on television the story is compelling all the more so because it is true the writers did their homework the accuracy of events is well documented the acting is great this has to be the best role sam waterston has ever had and the black and white cinematography was exceptional my only regret is that it is not available to buy a few years ago i contacted someone involved with the production either with pbs or in england and was told they had no plans to release it on vhs at the time this was a bbc production and ran in the us on american playhouse there is such an interest in seeing this just hard to believe no one can make it available,positive
i think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made and simply is its one and a half hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girlssure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since its a horror movie and i usually like horror movies ive no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever its no spectacle other than that its simply grotesque its so lame it even gets boring and really quick toothe worst thing if the above wasnt bad enough for ya about this movie is that theyve tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap hand held cameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough theres an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch in this film theres no other explanation than hey yall we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you cant make out what theyre saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound wise or other wisethan finally theres the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rockmy advise dont watch this under any circumstances,negative
your idol will deceive you in this movie stephen nichols is mis cast as a young german student still bending under his fathers orders although the actor obviously looks near years old this makes his relationship a collection of copulation scenes basically to a very young looking girl all the more disturbing the characters have no dimension and the war depiction serves only as a backdrop for this soft porn wannabe nichols who is one of daytime tvs best performers shows no passion in what is to be the main interest of this movie watching him have sex over and over with this girl its like watching two animals going at it if youre a fan of this actors talent in other projects dont rent this for you will never view him in the same way if on the other hand you want to see stephen nichols have an orgasm in front of the camera you might like it stephen will show you his naked butt lots of tongue work his groaning range but not his talent as this character whos obviously just as sex driven and misjudging as he was for wanting to do such personal things in front of the camera he may have found it kinky but i didnt a big deception,negative
an enthralling wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent martin scorsese many of the films he speaks of are easy to relate to his works particularly the earlier ones the silent era very enjoyable despite being a bit long i found this to be one of the best documentaries on film yet required viewing if you admire martin scorsese and his work,positive
this is the best of the films so far that christopher guest has created using his very talented ensemble cast previously theyd made the excellent waiting for guffman and following best in show they made the very enjoyable a mighty wind as for their latest for your consideration the less said the betterthe film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular you follow these few chosen dogs from pre show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious mayflower kennel club however none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world amazingly even though the characters are rather outlandish there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying as decades ago i had some experience with dog shows and this is a very cutthroat group of people my favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility i also loved the openly gay couple as they were terribly funny and clever however the best performance probably wasnt from any of the couples but from fred willard who played the worlds stupidest and least talented announcer in human history his comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed his as an incredibly stupid person how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyones guess the other contestants featured were also quite funny the high priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner the country boy and his hound as well as winkies parents who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the showdespite the improvised style of film making the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story one that is not for dog owners only exceptional acting made this one of the best comedies of the last decade clever and consistently funnyby the way try to find this on dvd as the extras were actually worth seeing while a bit painful to watch i loved seeing harlan pepper and his beach ball collection in particular,positive
i turned this off within the first five minutes its very sick and disturbing the moment i turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and its skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument this creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died the narrator said the animal dies instantaneously it didnt i dont agree with graphic realism towards animals insects or any living creature i was very disappointed as i had just watched eyes without a face which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached which spoilt my night as i couldnt hurt a fly never mind watching this savage documentaryreading other reviews on this page i had noticed they used words such as aesthetic this is not art or beauty i can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic,negative
shes the man is great its funny original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasnt in the best of moods man troublebut leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face the story is a bit out there with the whole no one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this hit could go down in history amanda b did a great job as the main role and channing tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous duke so girls go see this because its a great laugh and theres a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls all in all a brilliantfantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on dvd when it comes out,positive
this is definitely nolans most intimiteand thought provoking piece not to say that memento or insomnia are badbut they were definitely up to more hollywood standardswhile following is more of an indie flick the story is very brilliantand very well developed overallwatch this if your a fan of any of nolans workim sure youll be able to appreciate it more,positive
unbelievable philosophy depth genius masterpiece people must have seen another oldboy because the one ive seen was a badly written poorly conceived over the top acted sordid piece of kraapola which even ignoring for a moment the ludicrously violent scenes which makes it unsuitable for the eyes of a child could barely satisfy the imagination and the thirst for plot consistency of a seven years oldthe depth of this sorry concoction was exhausted in one little piece of wisdom laugh and the whole world will laugh with you weep and youll find yourself alone the type of boring fortune cookie saying which a great author be him shakespeare or more to the point of imdb kurosawa would have thrown in the garbage can with no second thoughts where this movie should have landed too if we wouldnt live in an era in which the cheaply shocking and the perversely disgusting are confused with what used to be named once great art in short yuck out of its not out of only because of some occasionally expert camera work in no way enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness though,negative
yes maybe there are parts of this film which require suspending belief a little but that doesnt take anything away from the films charm and wonder it was shown as part of our towns youth film festival and was the organising committees favourite which is not surprising the subject matter coming together in a race torn though post apartheid south africa is highly topical and the treatment of the theme is inspirational of course as the previous comment mentions the film does have its shortcomings but the realism of the setting and the way the director treats his subject matter belies these shortcomings i saw this with my wife and we returned the same evening with the children a film to watch meditate discuss and act upon,positive
spoiler alert this movie zero day gives an inside to the lives of two students andre and calvin who feel resentment and hatred for anyone and anything associated with there schoolthey go on a series of self thought out missions all leading up to the huge mission which is zero day zero days contents are not specified until the middle to the end of the movie the viewer knows its serious and filled with hate but is never quite sure until the endnow we all know if the movie is based on the columbine massacre the ending is pretty obvious and the ending is no different than any other movie about the attack they go and kill many of their fellow students in the endi have seen a lot of movies on this attack and this movie by far is my favorite and most respected it gives the viewer and inside look to the lives of these two teens who hate life and honestly it gives the viewer some what of an understanding and a closure on the horrible eventbeing only when the events played out i never knew the seriousness of the shootings until my english class was assigned an essay or story on a defining moment in our generation well i knew everyone was going to pick the twin towers but i wanted to be different because of course the twin towers was tragic and very defining but i didnt think it was the right choice for me because there was really no way of relating to that because i was only in the rd grade and i had no idea what it all meant but the shootings did leave and effect i remember the interviews the sky views of the school and the hurt and terror in the eyes of thousands of peoplethis movie is a compelling down to earth and horrific masterpiece and i would reccomened it to anyone,positive
im basing this on my observations of one episode i saw last night i dont think ill be watching again the acting was totally wooden the plot completely predictable the ending totally unrealistic i mean who would believe a million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer the lead actor victor garber seemed so uncomfortable almost embarrassed in his role perhaps he realized how bad the writing was i fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor but they can surely find better writers maybe they are outsourcing the writing to india or china ill bet we wont be seeing this one next season,negative
this movie is a pathetic attempt apparently to justify the actions of mary ann letourneau in order to do this they cast a year old well probably not in order to do this there was no way they could have cast a or year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out if they had even been allowed to do them as they should mary anns boyfriend was my nephews age making her a pedophile sixth grade people the definition of pedophile doesnt have to include many children all you need is onei really dont care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage she had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to the reason given is that she is bipolar rejected the diagnosis and refused to take her medication its understandable then that she was not thinking rationally one hopes that she now understands her actionsnow that she and vili are married and have two children together i pray that she is on her medication and thinking clearlyall that aside penelope ann miller was totally convincing and perfect casting for the role,negative
i know i loved this movie when i was years old now that i am i watched it again and i wished i hadnt because all the things i laughed at when i was younger is no longer funny so this is an hour and a half without fun for me the jokes were lame not funny or just too childish so the same thing i loved about the movie when i was a kid is now the things i dont like about it besides not being funny it is not actually believable at all the evil character is very poorly done but i guess that is the kind of movie it is and the last minutes of the movie is pretty lame with bad fighting sequences and so on but if you are young you will probably love it i rate this movie,negative
have just seen this film for the first time after purchasing it on dvdit comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan moviesunfortunately this film didnt appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects arent as flash and some scenes seem hurried nielsen is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldnt act if a gun was put to her head arnies supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director fleischer who also directed conan the destroyer maybe arnie wasnt confident that he would go on to headline films like predator total recall t etcsome of the female guardians of the talisman early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film i couldnt be so jovial if i was fighting for my lifeall this aside this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining ive seen a lot worse two stars,negative
the good the acting were great especially terrence howard and thandie newton terrence howard should have been nominated for best supporting actor instead of matt dillonthe bad im a visible minority non white and i have experienced some form of racism in my life but despite my life experiences and the movies subject matter i would definitely not say that this movie is the best of the year in fact its far from it i have problems with this movie both from a moviegoers perspective and from a visible minoritys perspective some of my problems with this movie are poor character development or none at all just because we saw extremes in a character for example matt dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father that does not mean in any way that the character is well developed yes i admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie it is quite difficult for every character to be well developed but that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that the dialogue seems really contrived to the point that im really surprised this movie won for best original screenplay they should show this movie in a screenplay writing class not because its good but to show students and future screenplay writers what not to do i just felt like ive been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is i get it the plot seems so coincidental it is laughable what are the chances of a black car robber running over an asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that asian guys van several hours later after he brought him the hospital only to find out that the several asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all or what about that scene where a prejudiced upper class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air if it was that simple why dont we throw every racist in america down the stairs so they will have a change of heart i think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism as someone who has experienced racism in my life the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face ive been refused to enter a supermarket because im not white did the store owner said because i was not white no he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside did he yell racial slurs no racism in america is more hidden some cab drivers probably wont stop to pick you up because youre non white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs if a chinese woman rear ended me i wont be saying blake blake learn some english bitch on the other hand if i was a chinese woman and i accidentally rear ended a mexican woman i wont say mexicans are bad drivers in front of her face thats not how things work instead i would give out my insurance info say sorry and go home and tell my fellow chinese friends and family that mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs that is the real racism its hidden and not in your faceanyway crash is not original unlike what some people may say the interlocking and interweaving story lines plots and characters have been done before magnolia is a movie that does this much better than crash did and yet it was never nominated for best picture at the oscars it had a stellar cast julianne moore william h macy phillip seymour hoffman who won best actor recently tom cruise etc it really boggles my mind how crash was even nominated for best picture,negative
okay so i love silly movies if you enjoy silly sci fi movies over the top movies or if you are a fan of mr bruce campbell i would go see this movie this movie is all that i wanted it to be being a fan of over the top movies this fit the bill every time i thought to myself this movie would be the sillest best movie ever if blank would happen then just as i thought it blank would happen its a wonderful silly b movie if you are a fan of campbell id say see it bring your friends laugh at it its fun its not classic or anything but if its on tv some night watch it it has become for me a movie i would file under indulgent movies movies that may not be good but after a hard day of work i could come home and watch this list also includes harold and kumar go to white castle army of darkness and intolerable cruelty if you feel like a over the top wonderfully slightly bad movie watch this if not go rent bubba ho tep,positive
i saw the film for the first time at bbc on july the of for me it was a good interpretation of the person conan doyleand i truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it i also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentionedyou may ask yourself was ac doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question however he was the creator of the famous holmesbut how much of it was a sort of semi biography not the less i strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see even if you arent interested in the sherlock holmes movies or books look a it enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it,positive
i wanted to love this film so badlyi really did but it was a horrible disappointmenti read jennifer egans novel in and was enthralled by the story in fact it remains one of my favorite books of all time mind you the book had much more depth than this movie in plot and emotional resonance it made you care about the characters it painted a complete picture of phoebe unlike the utterly poor characterization of the young girl in the filmthough beautiful and showing some promise in her burgeoning career jordana brewster was as flat and hollow in this performance as was the script and christopher eccleston wolf was just an awful choice for the role of wolf both physically and logistically what an awkward looking couple wolf should have been more of a dark brooding character and more physically alluring like he was in the book whats more the chemistry between the two actors was painfully forcedcameron diaz however deserves utmost praise for her performance she took an impossibly mediocre script and gave her character life a real spirit she is simply gorgeous and her careful mannerisms make her very believable as a hippie its too bad her talent was squandered on this forgettable filmin the book to movie category this is a dreadful translation almost as bad as message in a bottle with kevin costner but dont get me started on that onei am not usually so harsh in my critiques but i was so disappointed here because i really cared about the story and wanted to see it told right it did not deliver,negative
the film begins with promise but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation we are left hanging but with nothing much else save languid shots of grave and pensive male faces to savour certainly no rope up the wall to help us climb over its a shame because the concept is not without meritwe are left wondering why a loving couple a father and son no less should be so estranged from the real world that their own world is preferable when claustrophobic beyond all imagining this loss of presence in the real world is rather too obviously and unnecessarily contrasted with the son having enlisted in the armed forces why not the circus so we can at least appreciate some colour we are left with a gnawing sense of loss but sadly no enlightenment which is bewildering given the film is apparently about some form of attainment not available to us all,negative

i love the thackeray novel on which this film is based and while this modern version of becky sharps story is a b film the casting of loy in her first top billed role is rather fascinatingbefore loy became mgms reigning good girl in scores of genteel and comic roles she was an actress vanity fair was loys follow up film to emma in which she played a snotty and greedy daughter who almost destroys the loyal housekeeper marie dresslerloys becky is much nastier than miriam hopkins version years later in becky sharp loys becky is very much a pre code film character with her plunging necklines and amoral ways its the type of character that jean harlow or clara bow could easily have played but becky here is still supposed to be of the genteel set thats what makes her fallen character so tragicin counterpoint to loys grasping becky is the goody goody amelia barbara kent who is just not an interesting character mary forbes is icily good as mrs sedley most of the other actors in this version are pretty blah conway tearle as rawdon walter byron as osborne anthony bushell as dobbin others are nearly dickensian is their quirkiness billy bevan as joseph lionel belmore as crawley montagu love as the marquis lilyan irene as polly the maid elspeth dudgeon as the housekeeperloy is front and center throughout while the ending is rather shocking she has several excellent scenes such as the gambling scene in the casino where she tries to steal another womans winning roulette bet the more loys becky descends morally the more beautiful she gets until she is finally caught bottom line here is that this is a very solid performance by loy in a film that should be seen,positive
i sat through this film and i have to say it only just managed to keep my attention the film would have been a bit more bearable if i did not have to watch the awful cgi for future reference to the industry if your going to use cgi watch this so you know what to avoidapparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all i saw was a bad movie which bears no resemblance to a graphic novel whatsoeverall in all the story was not as bad as the cgi i was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but thats not surprising as like i said it only just kept my attention but in all honestly i wish i had given this one a miss,negative
this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying its quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most upn shows i never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re runsmost of its plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didnt have an original idea in their heads i havent commented enough youve got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a showthe gnome was a nice character,negative

a wide variety of snakes stage an uprising on tourists invading their island due their captains boat damage the few remaining survivors who arent caught vulnerable by the snakes will attempt an escape mission their goal to flee to available boats which can get them safely off the islandpresented straight faced with injected doses of visual humor featuring lots of snake gags wayne crawfords snake island features plenty of different breeds of the slithery predators in striking position ready to attack their prey star william katt as an author researching snakes for a forthcoming novel has fun in his role along with writer director co star wayne crawfordas the tourist boat captain as put upon heroes who stare down a most serious crisis kate connor is crawfords attractive love interest a lawyer on vacation the other cast members serve as either tourists or crew mostly fodder for the snakes as in many other movies of this type director crawford features live snakes with computer generated ones and the violence is really tame crawford even incorporates the point of view technique with the camera as the eyes of the snake as it faces the potential victimwith the actor looking directly into the camera never to be taken seriously the tongue in cheek approach was probably the best way to shoot snake island because the premise is just too ridiculous to accept on its ownthe effects and suspense scenes rarely work because crawford is often unable to successfully stage the sequences where humans face off with the snakes the snake attacks themselves also never happen on screenone or two tops or are so limply presented they leave little impression thats a no no for a genre such as this fans of katt will probably want to check it out because he does provide some facial comedy that establishes the overall tone of certain scenes where he must defend himself against the snakes the cgi scenes where we see a large number of snakes in a general area arent very effective which remove the realism crawford mightve attempted to establish there are plenty of better horror films featuring snakes as the aggressors than snake island surprising moments of nudity relegated to a scene where the tourists and crew unwind after a long day with the bubbly not knowing what danger lie ahead,negative
six students at a convent do the unthinkable kill a nun who was overbearing now eighteen years later the nuns spirit is back and getting revenge for her murderyea basically thats the short of it theres more to it than that but i still have no clue what it is the only really cool thing is the effects on the spiritual nun as i was pretty impressed for being a more low budget flick im also confused as to whether or not its in english most of the actors are italian and even the title here is in italian yet they spoke english in the film i think or it mightve been dubbed i still cant tellanyway the real premise of the film is pretty idiotic and the ending not only doesnt make sense itwelldoesnt make sense,negative
i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post screening survey i felt the films biggest problem was its lack of a main plot instead it was composed of too many sub plots competing for screen time as a result there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment what the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters in fact any one sub plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub plots and characters simply put the hungry bachelors clubs plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired,negative
what can i say this is one of the most perfect films ever made its a throwback to the glitxysterling romantic comedies of the sbut with a modern touchthe screenplay bursts with witcharmhumor and tendernessthe cinematograpy is breathtakingnyc never looked so beautifuland of course there is the cast dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveabledrunken arthur bach he is also wistful and realone of the films best lines is his poignant not everyone who drinks is a poetsome of us drink because were not poets the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobsonarthurs valet and caretakeralthough he considered it a take the money and run rolehe brings to the character all the talent experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian the supporting cast is also out of thisworldfrom geraldine fitzgeralds sassy grandma bach to stephen elliotts bombastic mafioso the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectlythe only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned,positive
i thought this film was excellent quirky and different to the usual run of the mill disengaged cop catching serial killer film kiefer sutherland was brilliant as usual i really dont think i have seen anything that he has done where he has not acted brilliantly the dialogue was funny at times lightening the mood and the plot engaging thanks to other reviewers for showing the link with alice in wonderland i hadnt picked up on those i would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of kiefer sutherlands as i am and to anyone who wants to watch an entertaining film for a couple of hours it was a shame that it wasnt released at the cinemas for a wider audience,positive
another popular screening for a british picture at coalvilles century theatre a well crafted solid drama with an ever developing plot and ongoing twists in the taleas the lies piled up a masterclass of acting by a flawless cast well marshaled by first time director julian fellowes outstanding performance as usual by tom wilkinson but good turns by all concerned including supporting actors linda bassett and john neville our audience was engrossed by this film which includes a couple of shock incidents which really make you jump a good tight production at around only minutes probably produced on a very limited budget but a success which should see fellowes directing again for the big screen some publicity for the film seemed to suggest it was set in the s as per nigel balchins novelbut obviously this is not the case recommended viewing,positive
this movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero one of the two movies ive ever walked out of its very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors wellarmageddon almost takes it but not quite,negative
silly movie is really really funny yes its got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but its laugh out loud funny all the way and its worth seeing just for ed mcmahon as a right wing kook this movie is in the same class as elvira mistress of the dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film,positive
this is the first tom hanks movie i have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater although he is my favorite when i heard he was going to play a hit man i was a little stunned thinking can mr hanks pull this one off and he did in high fashion this s depression era film is a about loyalty redemption and one path that you dont want your children stumbling down tom hanks leads a stellar cast as michael sullivan being the family man and the secret life of the contract killer for the oscar nominated paul newman this movie tom hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue which he delivers a knockout performanceon one night of one of his jobs michaels son michael jr played by newcomer tyler hoechlin witnesses the hit and michael srs partner in crime fellow stage actor daniel craig cant have that information out so he wacks out the son and wife of michael sr except michael jr so the two head for chicago to get conner rooneyson of paul newmans mr rooneythe drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right even though son is along for the ride while on this deadly journey someone has hired a hit for michael sr the assassin would be the photographer of the deceased harlen maguire played by a stain teethed jude lawthe movie will have you feeling the old days and with thomas newmans beautiful and haunting oscar nominated score to go along with it you cant help but appreciate this film from oscar winning director sam mendes so sit back and enjoy the wild ride,positive
this is not so bad that it is good it is purely good for those who dont understand why you have the intellect of a four year old in response to a certain comment anyways killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself a parody of you and a parody of me it is the single most genius text in cinematic history i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard i write scripts and this movie single handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me the likes of which we have never seen it can only be taken in portions its sort of exploitive by now im just trying to take up the ten line minimum my comment ended a while ago hopefully it works when i submit it now,positive
this is an excellent movie i have been watching it since i was yrs old with my big sister it is the type of movie that u can watch over and over again and still laugh smile and cry every time with out ever getting bored of it like other movies it is a movie that will live on forever through generations of family i love it when ranking from in my case i would rate it easily every time itis a film about the change of a girl baby and her first boy friend johnnytheir relationships within the family the changes in babys and johnnys view of the world during their relationshipdirty dancing will forever live on as a timless classic thank you sorry though for only the short comment,positive
well made documentary focusing on two sudanese refugees who get resettled in the united states its your basic fish out of water story with a non fiction twist i found it fascinating to see how peter and santino lived prior to coming to america and how they adapted once they arrived here in houston texas they expected a sort of heaven but found out that its a lot harder than it looks to cope well in the states they go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics everywhere they go they meet bureaucrats with paper trails that most citizens may take for granted they fret that they are blacker than the african americans here and dont feel accepted because of that one of the lost boys manages to leave houston to go to olathe kansas where he finds conditions slightly better but still less than ideal there are people that try to help them as well as try to hurt them in this film not shown but talked about are those who put a gun to their heads and robbed them leading one lost boy to comment negatively that all black people in america are no good i found it interesting too that they arrived in houston in august a month before the world trade center was attacked by terrorists i had hoped to see their reaction to this tragedy but its not mentioned at all still all in all a really well done documentary with no narration none is needed really the lost boys do a fine job expounding on the events going on around them without any help at all thank you very much,positive
i loved this it starts out as a fairly normal slightly ponderous french art movie and then all of a sudden halfway through its turned on its head this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching plots not one sadly the ending doesnt make much sense which is a great shame oh yes and its brilliantly filmed,positive
i agree that this film achieved its goals perfectly i saw it on showtime late at night as a teenager and again in college i thought it was funny and there are boobs everywhere it seems like in the late s and s there were loads of this type of film made from r rated films like porkys to soft core au pair girls its a shame they seem to have fallen by the wayside in terms of popularity the thing that made hots great was that like the previous two films its a hell of a lot of fun hots is like a girl power version of animal house with the girls forming a sorority of sorts and engaging in campus bedlam on a side note whoever designed the hooters girls outfits must certainly have seen this film,positive
may or may not contain spoilers inuyasha is not a good anime its actually very overrated why theres absolutely no story line no plot and the show just drags on and on and on thats because there are more side stories and fillers than episodes that make the plot progress and the fillers are just the same stories being repeated over and over again the same episodes seem to go with the same plot kagome sensing a jewel shard a worm slime tentacle demon thing pops up inuyasha says wind scar iron reaver soul stealer etc and kills the demon they get the jewel shard and then we just repeat this scene or more timesbesides the repeating of episodes theres the repeating of comedic devices and theyre not funny anymore wait they never were sexual harassment is not funny viz rated the series older teens i have no idea why they rated it that theres nothing bad about it except for the so called funny sexual harassment which is kind of suggestive and that could get you arrested these daysnow this is how we know inuyasha is overrated the videogames they all sucked especially the mask game i played that at my friends house it wasnt anything interesting the game was slow boring and it had nintendo like graphics in a magazine it got a rating of saying this role playing game is slower than milkshake moving up a cocktail straw then theres all these stupid inuyasha toys action figures trading cards stickers and coloring books coloring books we thought inuyasha was maybe not but after being a member of inuyasha groups on msn about half the people on there were to i guess inuyasha is a little kid anime after all i think that just a small bit of editing done to this show it could be shown on toonami there are over manga volumes i can only help but wonder how many miles of forest that have been cut down to make them sadthen theres the music the music is so annoying we hear the same songs every episode after episodes the music gets really annoying in other anime they have music to fit the mood and we dont hear some songs very often there are about different inuyasha soundtracks dont waste your money on that garbageand how do you think i know all this because i used to be a fan of inuyasha i feel ashamed of myself id rather watch kim possible or pokemon instead sadly those two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than inuyasha will ever have,negative
wow i have seen some really bad movies in my time but this one truly takes the cake its the worst movie ive seen in the past decade no exaggerationas a us army veteran of the war in afghanistan i found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film not because it brought back memories far from it but because there was absolutely no attempt at authenticity to be found anywhere in the film not so much as the tiniest little shred it seemed like it had been written by an year old child who got all his notions of war and soldierly behavior straight out of comic books the film was made in honduras which should have been a clue but even that cant fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché ridden piece of trashi could try to list all the endless technical flaws but it would take virtually forever from the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since wwii and the characters name tags like colcollins worn by the character colonel collins which was actually spelled using the reversed mirror image n of the russian alphabet not the us alphabet the list just goes on and on the uniforms the equipment the plot and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves every single scene was just chock full of ridiculous flaws inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichésneither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable it was all laughably childish in the extreme this was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre pubescent boys and i have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurdin short this film has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all its a total waste of time id strongly advise anybody reading this to pass this garbage by its truly not worth wasting a single moment of your time for,negative
the audience sat in silence through almost the entire film with only a few rare occasional chuckles the character of maxwell smart was so inconsistent i felt whip lashed when it is convenient for the plot smart behaves like a master spy at other times he acts like an imbecile they lift many classic lines from the television series but they dont work in this version the classic missed it by this much is funny if it is spoken with attempted braggadocio by someone who is an obvious failure but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is qualified to a slightly lesser degree many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent siegfried the main villain would seem to be intelligent but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all still none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess i am utterly depressed that so many imdb users think this was good,negative
ruth gordon is one of the more sympathetic killers that columbo has ever had to deal with and the plot is ingenious all the way around this is one of the best columbo episodes ever mariette hartley and g d spradlin are excellent in their supporting roles and peter falk delivers a little something extra in his scenes with gordon,positive
i loved this movie i totally disagree with some negative critiques that ive read over the years this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it and most of his audience enjoyed it and it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr murphys great comedic style you have to keep in mind that golden child is a fantasy film just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world during the time this film was released i was working in a video rental store this was one of the most popular with all our customers every single time we put this one up on our monitor all the copies we had went out fast with wait list requests that kept it on the queue for months everyone who rented it loved it i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them i really feel that this film is a sleeper it may not have done too well at the box office due to very poor marketing but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later yes i did buy this film for my own video library i adored the little boy who played the golden child j l reate but after looking at his profile in imdb i noticed that he never did any more films that is sad because he definitely had an on screen aura and could have continued with a film career i also adored victor wong who played the old man i loved him in his part as egg shen in big trouble in little china at any rate this was a great film the only drawbacks that didnt seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more adult in nature such as chandlers rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette it was funny but it still was out of sync ok so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes those were put in for the mind set of the day perhaps this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood now thats entertainment,positive
this films a big bore it has a plenty of predictable plots endless sentiments from the start it starts good with a classy number but seems lost midwaysurya jyothikas on screen chemistry works out really good a good part by bhoomika why include vadivelu in it he disappears totally after a good half an hour santhanam proves his wit again by timing comedyars tunes sure will last for sometime but he could have done better what ever be the drawbacks still its worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good time pass,negative
fritz lang directed two great westerns western union and the return of frank james the frank james movie equals jesse james western union is one of randolph scotts great westerns i have never seen robert young in a western before he is terrific as the telegraph employee this is the only movie i can think of that is about the telegraph company opening up in the west it is a high geared story about the telegraph in the west a triangle love story and about loyalty the supporting cast is superb dean jagger who made a few westerns plays the telegraph manager virginia gilmore who plays mr jaggers sister is the love interest in the movie ms gilmore had a short career in movies she quit films in and became a drama coach she is primarily known as the first mrs yul brynner it is great to see slim summerville in a movie with mr scott again they were in two other great movies rebecca of sunnybrook farm and jesse james,positive
john cassavettes decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in new york to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a feature equivalent of larry davids curb your enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk in other words its one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in its score and telling a tale of racial tensions a group of black siblings are the center point with one trying to get better gigs than the average strip club and has a sister much more light skinned than him who gets entwined with a white man in a relationship which shatters both sides the film however isnt exclusively about that cassavettes likes to have his characters wander around new york city which not many films did in and his style of storytelling is like that of the improvisational jazz artists of the day dated to be sure but worth a glance for film buffs martin scorsese named this as one of his heaviest influences,positive
steven seagals films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since the patriot the plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who the film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the directors feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame oh and i havent even mentioned how awful the acting is even by seagal standards even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for seagal fans give it a wide berth,negative
so many films are now in a genre described as comedy thriller as was this one a fine cast interesting premise but what an unpleasant film to watch into hemp films then either saving grace or lock stock are far more enjoyable films rating just out of roach clips,negative
a group of tourists are stranded on snake island after an unfortunate accident with their boat they are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected it isnt called snake island because its just soooooo much fun to say it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the large snake population which is just what happens with these poor dumb souls this is a very boring and typical movie with tons of off screen snake attacks and lousy performances from nobody actors the only somewhat entertaining scene was an absolutely unnecessary and forced strip scene which aint anything couldnt see in a pg rated movie folks if you are into snake movies than check out sssssss but dont torture yourself with this crap,negative
i wrote spoiler alert but theres not really much that can be spoiled its like spoiling rotten meat this movie is probably the worst ive ever seen not because of the actors or the special effects but because of the sheer number of mistakes both factual and physical first of all the migs arent actually migs at all theyre mirages and theyre french and how the heck can dougs dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the migs without a g suit and why would chappy try to board his plane without a g suit and how could doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease anyway i did not like this movie and the worst part is that it has sequels the latest one from as late as now thats scary,negative
claudine is a movie that is representation of the american system at its worst the welfare system was initially set up as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feetthe movie showed an accurate portrayal of how the welfare system breaks down the family unit in other words if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children their financial support from the system would be jeopardized if not terminated the struggles of the poor can be seen throughout the world i would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the stores for all to rent or buy for their library collection,positive
the strong points in the film were clear for the beginning and middle part of the film it showed how a very violent reactive authority might react to resistance filmed in the fashion of a documentary the director captures what would have happened if the united states enacted martial law volunteering for punishment park a training ground for cops where youre bullied and harassed would offer you an out to this dire scenario it switches between the court trials for those facing accusations those who are in the park escaping police attention the training of officers preparing to handle these prisoners the judges in their leisure time among many other things it was a very strong deeply moving filmthe only fault i had with this was its realism officers are often seen holding their pistols like they were seven years old with a plastic toy ie a degree bent elbow when pointing a gun in someones face or the way one cop just makes it look like its hard to kick someone when theyre down etc etc it starts out as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs by the end of the film the viewer is slowly reminded again and again of the prejudices of the director and the producers the antagonist characters in the story start out as genuine real human beings and then slowly progress into stereotypical objectifiable forces of evil by the very end the mistakes they make are stupid the force they demonstrate is unreal and unlike the way real police act the judges during this court hearing are shown making stupid and unreal mistakes among many other thingsthe realness of the movie started to fall apart when it became evident that this was just another blank check attempt to make government look bad and thats coming from an anarchist the scenes at the end started to get hokey unreal and a thousand times over dramatic still for the earlier part of it it promises some very moving storyline,positive
youve gotta hand it to steven seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women if you pick a seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it and usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc flight of fury offers the duo of ciera payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match angelina jolies and katie jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling and if it seems like im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about ironically the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care this being a military type actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking,negative
tis and as lots of boobies some great characters fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the amercan pie franchise this feels like really old school it feels a bit like porkys for the s some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for mewhilst the original cast is all but gone except for one this movie i found really entertaining lets not get too excited you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is but for what it is it excels the characters are likable and funny the girls are hotter than hell the fun and games are hilarious with some stuff ive never seen before in comedies they make me cringe but laugh at the same timeso ignore the haters and give this a run and see what you think dont expect the classic american pie but expect something that should make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so,positive

this movie was craptacular i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself i played it beautifully throughout promising myself i would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way even in this state i couldnt help but notice that cubas acting was as flimsy as tracing paper his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards burt came on the screen as a general thats right a general who wears too much makeup i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cubas except mine was real and i stubbed my toe recompense recompense my stubbed toe,negative
i really felt the movie was ahead of its time the one potential daughter in law was such a strong career oriented woman she knew what she wanted and was diplomatic but firm with the over bearing mother in law to be the mothers role was played extremely well you just loved to hate her her need to control her sons lives was neurotically evil if youve ever been in a relationship where youve been judged and found lacking and everybody involved knew it this may hit too close to home its been years since i saw this movie and i remember thinking that this plot and dialog would work in a s or s movie it is difficult to watch because of the mother and sons dynamic but i would love to watch it again i keep hoping to find it on one of the old movie channels but so far no luck attempts to buy it were also futile i dont believe its on tape or dvd,positive
i watched this movie purely for the setting it was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of the plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scaresi dont remember much of the plot and i think thats because there wasnt much of one to remember they didnt even use the hotel to its fullest potentialthe beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula at low tide you can walk almost mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracksthe best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and im using that term looslyscenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings,negative
what you were not aware that scooby doo battled zombies well you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin who had also directed white zombie four years earlier that would probably make it the second zombie film madeno dont go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films and dont even look for any brains being eaten this is you knowso what you will see is typical of the period lots of talkingyou do get to see dean jagger twelve oclock high and bela lugosis eyes but that is about it zombies in cambodia indeed,negative
my roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her shes from china and only heard so much about and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary i felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyesbut im extremely grateful that i watched this documentary because on the day of september th im sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions why how whats going on oh my god almost all the americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others but i dont think we thought about what they were really going though this wasnt actually supposed to be a documentary about the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the world trade centers and got everything outside and in on tapeon sep th i thought to myself its ok the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived to be honest i thought it was an accident i was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class someone came into the locker room shouting some building just got bombed in new york we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on tv not only seconds later live on tv does the second plane crash into the other world trade center and we knew this was no accident a few minutes later we heard about the pentagon and that there was a plane headed for chicago but was shot down so many thoughts ran through our heads and i kept on thinking what are the firemen and policemen going to do but its procedure to them i thought theyll know what to dothe first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions they didnt know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers they heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows and here i was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on tv i was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to new york and tell them how grateful all the americans were for their help i know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were heros every day after sep th for weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying may god bless their kind and brave heartsas for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks she got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day she asked why i didnt know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil it sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary no one expected this to happen not like that those people in the world trade centers or the pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by they were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this they celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc why so thanks to those people for making this documentary you truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world thank you to all those people you are our heroes,positive
being an austrian myself this has been a straight knock in my face fortunately i dont live nowhere near the place where this movie takes place but unfortunately it portrays everything that the rest of austria hates about viennese people or people close to that region and it is very easy to read that this is exactly the directors intention to let your head sink into your hands and say oh my god how can that be possible no not with me the in my opinion totally exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary i watch porn sure but in this context i was rather disgusted than put in the right contextthis movie tells a story about how misled people who suffer from lack of education or bad company try to survive and live in a world of redundancy and boring horizons a girl who is treated like a whore by her super jealous boyfriend and still keeps coming back a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super cruel lover on the line an old couple who has an almost mathematical daily cycle she is the official replacement of his ex wife a couple that has just divorced and has the ex husband suffer under the acts of his former wife obviously having a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her drivers the most unusual questions and stretches their nerves by just being super annoyingafter having seen it you feel almost nothing youre not even shocked sad depressed or feel like doing anything maybe thats why i gave it points it made me react in a way i never reacted before if thats good or bad is up to you,positive
classic drama action western with incredible cinematography that is well ahead of its time the production is very good and you can tell that it was done with pride and loveunique peek into the american northt west pioneers is very educational and entertainingthis movie is very under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many lawmen during this particular time and place were very crooked corrupt much like most developing countries todaythe action sequences could have been more realistic though but stillthis movie really covers most of the essentialsnot for an audience who wants only pure testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy,positive
i have never understood the appeal of this show the acting is poor debra jo rupp being a notable exception the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring the dialogue is weak the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode furthermore the link between this show and the s is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that both happy days and the wonder years employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible pathetic excuse for a show,negative
this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch i should have expected it after seeing the first two but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of maybe they did it right this time nope not even closewhere do i begin how about with the special effects to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie at one point a soldier is shooting at a raptor as it runs down a hallway even with less than a second of screen time the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around bad bad bad badhow about the acting if thats what you can call it there is one character who i suppose is supposed to be from the south however after living in the south for six years now i have never heard this way of talking perhaps he has some sort of weird disability the inability to talk normally i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do onehow about the plot its pretty basic raptors escape people with guns must hunt them down im starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels wouldnt they stay outside to hunt prey oh well at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around themother things lets say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better army or marine and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors split up into groups of two didnt they ever watch any horror movies or at least an episode of scooby doo in short this is one of the dumber movies out there miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie,negative
as an avid fan of cary grant i expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter as amc billed it as a comedy i have never been more disappointed with a film carys usual charm and effortless comedy are awol from this entire movie he comes across as strained bored and just not himself mississips character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes i have ever witnessed his accent is terribly exaggerated and incorrect according to which part of mississippi he claims to hail from and whenever he does deliver a line its several decibels higher than any other cast member mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable country bumpkin goofball but in the end he manages only to detract from the already weak plot mansfield looks more like an obscene blow up doll than a hollywood sex kitten and while she was never known in hollywood for her acting ability this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with ray walstons character was sugary and ultimately contrived for four men on shore leave it was the tamest leave ive ever seen i watched this nightmare until its very end and while i wont spoil that for anyone i will tell you that its the most absurd youll ever see the film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast sorry cary,negative
a truly muddled incomprehensible mess most things in the film look more or less like but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the policemans ray gun and that car the director seemed to be in love with colored lights the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie but since there was no cast listing i dont know which actress that was this one is worth missing grade f,negative
as a canadian history major my first thing to say historical facts are not accurate how can a producer do that the deportation of the acadian wasnt in when we see franklin in london but in how can he pass that in the movie the scenes in londo were useless too then for the story for anyone that read les anciens canadians you have the story line right there its the story of la coriveau that witch add a love story too and a tragic relationship between mother and daughter ending sure it brought tears to my eyes but thats it then theres the fact its apparently set up in québec city but its mostly shot at the forteresse de louisbourg sure its a historical site and its accurate to the time but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in québec city overall if youre looking for a documentary of new france go get candad a peoples history a real documentary on the history of canda and new france if you want a love story that will bring you tears a story set up in a wonderful forest watch new france,negative
i wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it it starts out with jean stapleton and a randy newman song in iowa northwest iowa i guess reminiscent of norman lears cold turkey which was one of the best movies ever made according to people on imdb so far so good and the idea of the archangel michael living at pansy milbanks motel on earth well give it a chance its supposed to be a comedy okay so far so good but michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had the other characters in the movie dont have much appeal either michael brings a dog back to life and were supposed to be in awe of that the people make up corny country songs in the end stapleton dances with travolta big deal if she was smart she wouldnt even be in this movie when it was over i thought gee what a stupid tasteless boring corny sacrilegious movie its not fit to be seen by children or anyone else,negative
pandoras clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see a highly faithful adaptation of john j nances novel which had a frightfully real scenario in the novelis made even more so here despite being made for tv this is first rate entertainment the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date jane leeves is great her role as an ambassadors assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor daphne zuniga is great as dr sanders and despite the character being a man in the book it works incredibly well robert loggia edward herrmann robert guillaume and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letterthere are changes to the story of course including and a slight change in the ending but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago they work fine sets are great especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this workit doesnt matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa just do both and you wont regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel this will leave you breathless,positive
remember the good ol animated batman show from the s the one that people praised the one that people of all ages could all appreciate the one that showed batman as a real detective instead of the hulk in a bat suit the one that had villains you could relate to the one that had villains with real motiveswell clearly warner bros doesnt hence this dreckhonestly do these people know anything about batman have they even looked at a batman comic before do they know batmans meant to be a detective putting together clues does not make you a detective that makes you a slightly intelligent monkeythis is the basic layout for an episodepenguin steals something opening credits batman finds dead giveaway of where he is batman goes there and gets into trouble commercial batman finds obvious stupid way out of it penguin escapes penguin does something obvious again batman follows they do kung fu by the way everyone and i mean everyone knows kung fu for some reason batman punchs penguin he gets knocked out goes to arkham note its usually a different villain every episodewell as you may have noticed from that batmans not a great detective joker left this piece of cotton candy on the ground maybe hes at the old amusement park yeah maybe he was there the last timesand ive already mentioned this but everyone knows kung fu even penguin what where they thinking probably because its from the people who made that jackie chan animated serieswhats really upsetting is that the show is just action no smarts none if batman needs think hell use technology then do some kung fubut hey lets not forget the villains afterall what would batman be without his rogues gallerywell first off i gotta say kudos for originality i dont think other batman media would have envisioned joker and a dread locked monkey man riddler like an emo and poison ivy as a minor which is kind of confusing when you think about isnt her sexuality meant to be her main strengthwhats even more crap however is that every character is now a dimensional stereotypical crookegkiller croc wants to flood gotham for no reasonman bat is a power hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some unexplained reasonpenguin just wants to steal everything for no reasonnoticing a pattern herebut the most insulting has got to be mr freezedo you remember the emmy award winning heart of ice episode from batman the animated series the one that gave mr freeze motives for his crimes the episode that was so good that it was used in the comics over his original back story mad scientist the one that made him a victim with a goal hell even batman robin acknowledged that using that as mr freezes origin in that pos moviewell this series says fck that and makes mr freeze a jewelry robber before his accident with only wealth in his mind then gets frozen and gives him the power to make things cold he then continues to steal jewels for no reason while saying sht lines like have an ice daymaybe they did watch batman robin after allbut hey look on the bright side this series makes you feel nothing for the villains so that means that youre a good person good for you,negative
i enjoyed this movie granted it is mainly because i enjoy seeing sean connery act and this one has the added bonus of having ed harris and lawrence fishburne in it too the story has a grandma seeking out connerys assistance because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted at first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to coerce a confession out of the boy well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison one who is about to be put to death he is a particularly nasty person too as he takes a lot of joy in what he did writing the relatives of his victims and trying to get people to mail them a lot of twists and turns in this one with some of it being somewhat unexpected me i just enjoyed sean connerys character trying to make sense of the whole ordeal the movie also made me mad in areas especially when you find out what ultimately happened you get very good interplay between connery and harris and connery and fishburne as they all shine rather well in this one in the end this one makes for a rather good suspense thriller,positive

now i do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some indians have concerning their women and sexuality i have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society with women being murdered because the husbands family doesnt want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing i also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in india a decade ago as a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie most western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this filmalthough i am a male am not rabidly feminist and i am straight the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is not an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by lesbians and man haters in fact i dont think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands yes i use the word wicked and mean it as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses sexuality in many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existenceone husband married a vivacious young woman sita out of family obligation this arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband however he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about sita and he continues to have an affair with a liberal minded chinese lady to make matters worse he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies in their dead marriage sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met and unfortunately he could have cared lessanother husband was married to a lady who was infertile radha oddly after initially trying to have children they have gone the next years without any sexual contact whatsoever its because this man has decided to become an ascetic ie in hinduism a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment now his wanting to do this was all well and good if he was not already married and had obligations for his wife however being married this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care the closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh this must have brought nothing but frustration to herso youve got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs eventually these needs bring these sister in laws together at first just emotionally but later sexually as well the movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolationlate in the film when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from radhas enlightened husband a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossiblethis is a very challenging and adult film while there is very little nudity the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady as i said this is not a film to let your kids watch however for a mature audience this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to thinkthe film features good acting complex characters excellent writing lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some but which i found rewarding the only serious negative i cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape this is because although the movie is in english the accents are quite strong at times and its not always easy to understand whats being said but and this is the worst part there are no closed or open captions including them is a must for western audiences if you do watch this film see if you can find it on dvd or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning mine sure didntby the way director deepa mehta a popular female director has made several other wonderful films such as earth and bollywood hollywood a consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional indian culture and expectations and westernism with a strong emphasis on female characters not surprisingly this west thinking lady makes her home in canada and is divorced a truly unusual woman to say the least for a similar film that explores traditional culture meets western culture try another canadian gem eat drink man woman,positive
fado is a sad almost bluesy style of portuguese gypsy music that is heard repeatedly trough the movie as explained by one of the main characters igor it also means fateindeed its fate that bring the two main characters paco and alex together and triggers the problems that ensueon the whole i enjoyed it quite a bit it starts out as an on the down and outs drama road movie an builds into a suspenseful thriller road moviethere were two things that i found unrealistic that kept me from giving it a higher rating i gave it an the first is the major point of why did alex give the stuff away she was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a paltry sum and then she gives away things worth thousands to a stranger her explanation was unconvincing also how did they get through the gate where were the cops,positive
this is another of the many b minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it all aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre the acting by the three leads is wooden i guess john dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing tv work lee j cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction jane wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers the movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that i have ever seen the one in which john dall goes after lee j cobb is particularly strange the dvd transfer is typical alpha,negative
loved todays show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer peeking around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as personable as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the first theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by golly ill be writing those recipes down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who havent tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you wont be disappointed,positive
i didnt expect much when i decided to watch this movie so i was surprised to find myself thoroughly enjoying it a couple of scenes had me laughing almost uncontrollably the characters were engaging no pun intended however the story is predictable the fun of it comes from watching crawl shores character a ditzy yet wise california dude a country college girl brings home for thanksgiving trying in his awkward yet endearing way to fit in to their lifestyle i was also surprised that in all this there was a message if you have a chance see this movie,positive
marked for death spends more time on action sequences than it does with focusing on its characters after his first two impressive efforts above the law and hard to kill this third steven seagal picture makes the idea clear anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool the bad guys are just there to make him look goodseagal had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kick em up antics of chuck norris or jean claude van dammein marked for death seagal tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation this film contains loads of graphic violence gore and nudity that seem to be there for no reason other than to please rowdy moviegoers who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour on the thrills without rhyme or reason and he deserves some real blame for this lapse in taste as a producer of marked for deathseagal plays john hatcher a retired dea agent who comes home to chicago where his family is being attacked by a jamaican street gang who attack his sisters house and the film proves that it isnt squeamish when hatchers niece danielle harris is shot in the crossfire hatcher gets mad and he decides to team up with his old friend max keith david a school gym teacher and charles tom wright a jamaican copnaturally hatcher declares war on the chief bad guy a dread locked jamaican voodoo priest called screwface basil wallace a nickname that apparently means outrageous overacting and it is almost unbelievable in the way seagal picks off various members of the gang he gouges one guys eyeball he breaks a guys back and he breaks numerous arms and limbsall logic for this movie is thrown out the window through the glass that is why arent hatcher and friends indicted for all the property damage they cause or the body count that piles up and how did they get their cache of automatic weapons from illinois to jamaica by plane without being detected seagal has a clint eastwood stoicism about him that fans once seemed to enjoy and despite the three different characters hes played in as many films each dresses in oriental black bathrobes and wears a ponytail one of the problems that i have with some of seagals movies is that the main characters never seem to be in serious jeopardy and because hes the star of course no one can lay a glove on him except for the bad guyseagals heroes are all interchangeable as are most of the plot lines and action sequences regardless of whether hes masquerading as a ships cook a fire fighter or an la cop wearing love beads seagal is always seagal which is exactly what his fans want in fact the sameness of these films is such that if i wanted to i could take an old review change the names and have a reasonably accurate take on the new movie not that id ever really do that,negative
whats there to say about pink flamingos it is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesnt really aspire to be like any other movie youve seen you will either get it or you wont laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust or both john waters is an odd filmmaker putting that mildly mixing both innocent childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended towell who knows what his intentions were it is like a form of assault albeit a funny onethe thing that makes waterss humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer like the petty rivalries that form the plot of pink flamingos surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of the filthiest person alive what makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that waters creates giddy self contained environments and doesnt let you in on the joke right away the people in his films are completely in tune with one another for instance when cotton tells babs that she doesnt want to accompany her into town because crackers is bringing his lady friend out to the trailer babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her in a conspiratorial aside that little sheds just perfect at this point we do not know yet that crackers plans to take his lady friend out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while cotton watches orgasmically through a window but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that waters createsanother example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and channing the marbles deviant butler the first time we see them waters cuts jarringly from a scene in connies cozy office to channing descending into the basement where we see that there are two women down there one dead and one very much alive and ped off susan is not a cowering victim but is enraged and abusive to channing leaping up to launch a full scale verbal attack on her jailer they both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious she does not let up for one second while channing is in her sight and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film later in the film when divine and crackers break into the marbless home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement it represents the total lack of support that divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the marbles are pandering here is something divine is unfamiliar with a corruption devised by her newfound rivals and she despises it furthermore while kidnapping does not seem like something divine would think twice about she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free relishing the revenge that they take on channingat the other end of the filth spectrum waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the real world the first time we see connie she is belittling a minor character named sandy sandstone who has never heard of divine cookie on the other hand reacts with a hilariously matter of fact evaluation of divines title as the filthiest person alive revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as wellsomething also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles especially divine who doesnt miss a note not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character hes been given and it takes pink flamingos to a new level or weirdness people actually believed divine was like this in real life and its easy to understand why because while watching the movie youre not really thinking about the movie youre thinking about these people who made it since theyre really doing the outrageous things in the script you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentarybut even more so pink flamingos is not so much a movie as it is an event or something that happens to you even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now i say mostly because the ahole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince i still find this film to be hilarious and habit forming,positive
batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny devito as the penguin devito and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has fulfilled how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as crap although we are all entitled to our own opinions,positive
please dont waste your money on this sorry excuse for a motion picture the only way i could see someone watching this is if they are a die hard fan of erika elaniak but you would be better off surfing the internet than to watch this piece of crap i would rather watch paint dry than go through watching this they lure you in with casper and erika and lead you to believe it is a sci fi dracula movie but it quickly works out to be a farce about van helsings great great you get the point grandson here ironically for one last show down between himself and draculathe movie also tries to make a political statement i believe when it appears that none of the characters in the future know who god is that they have not been taught about him and dont understand when they see a cross could have done a lot more with this idea its a shame it turned out the way it did,negative

first off this is an excellent series though we have sort of a james bond effect what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in it is chronologically the first adventure of dr no being the second while in golden eye the first film with pierce brosnan judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male m so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double aside from the fact that she is obviously years older this is more or less a poetic license to thrill we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained no the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago in the s communicators were fantasy now we call them cell phones and there were sliding levers instead of buttons omg do you think years from now they would have perfected rogaine for jean luc picard so please lets give the producers some leewaybut to try and make things a bit consistent let us just ponder about the cylons creation just years prior to the end of battlestar galactica if that is the case where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space well what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship loaded with human looking cylons wound up not only jumping through space but through time back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one they colonized it found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves but not before they themselves sent out a ragtag fleet to search for the legendary caprica only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet which they colonized to become the humans who eventually invented the cylons time paradox of course which came first the chicken or the road who cares its fraking entertaining,positive

vulpine massacre should have been this movies actual title and the tag line should have read guaranteed to make your kids cry this is a nature drama telling the story of a family of wild foxes in a remote region starting with the meeting and pairing of two young foxes and the eventual birth of a large family and the trials of raising them the only speaking is done in narrative by a tree that stands over the den giving insight into the animals loves and lives lovely scenery and gorgeous filming of the animals sounds good huh well from there things go straight to hell and then start drilling towards the core spoilers below or they it may be a warningalmost first off we learn one of the foxes is born blind but seems to get along well enough and theres a beautifully cheerful musical score to accompany him and then he dies next we have one of the siblings adventures and then he dies one of the sisters gets her screen time and then she diesand so it goes like some horrific slasher movie as one fox after another is killed off by nature in traps just up and vanish and even by a bunch of snowmobiles by the end of the movie almost all the foxes have been massacred though mercifully no deaths are shown on screen least not in the version we saw unlike say tarka the otter the deaths in this movie are almost all pointless and border on the sadistic in the way hopes are built up and then snuffed out one or two losses would have been acceptable it is a nature film after all but not nearly the whole familydo not go to see this film deceived by the cheery box into thinking its safe for the kids watch it with some foreknowledge that things are not going to go well at all and that you or your kids may be left feeling very badly depending on how sensitive you or they are you may enjoy it or you may not,negative
i saw this film years ago on tnt it was susanah yorks birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones i have not seen this film on tv since i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale as lusty the sailor i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette but anyway he is quite funny this is a fast paced comedy it is not on vhs or dvd columbia pictures should go through their film collection and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor this is a bawdy comedy the kind of film one no longer sees with great production values stars out of,positive
everything this film tried to do is done better and superbly in run lola run the red haired hip cutie the critical deadlines the lover in jeopardy and the crime pays sometimes message but unlike lola it just isnt believable or well put together it is a labored knock off that might have worked for me if i had seen it before lola but it pales in comparison yes the falling beetle was nice but that was about the only surprise in the film do yourself a favor and see the real mccoy and the real hip red head in run lola run,negative
tillman jrs drama about the first african american navy master diver gooding jr who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer the screenplay is not bad a bit extreme at times but the direction and acting is first rate and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do i liked deniro in the lead although its not on par with his masterful works taxi driver godfather and all the others it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart deniro is always convincing and believable here very good performance gooding jr is not bad definitely one of his better performances imdb rating my rating,positive
captain willard martin sheen has been sent on a classified mission into cambodia during the vietnam war to assassinate colonel kurtz marlon brando as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders and since kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces it is hard for capt willard to understand how col kurtz could go off the deep end as he has killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands what possibly could have pushed this great man over the top through willards long journey through the jungle to find his target he tries with some success to understand why but what will he decide to do once he finds himany movie that can start out with the doors the end is a great movie in my book especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song apocalypse now does this perfectly i cant think of anything better for it to be set to the vietnam war and the insanity in the soliders minds that it created an is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in vietnam the ultimate destination of which is murder through its use of music and score alone we are thrown into a dark world of mystery violence and insanity a perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here an overall great cast with the exception of laurence fishburne of which sheen and brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread i just dont like fishburne ever since i found out he was cowboy curtis in peewees playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold i realize the pettiness of this but i simply do not care we need to sick gary oldman on him brando is excellent as col kurtz and i cant think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence sheen is also fun to watch as willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general my favorite character in the movie has to be robert duvalls lt colonel kilgore before this film i never pictured duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly its my favorite of his parts to date he simply nailed his character which is one of the best in the entire film as the gung ho air cavalry commander who loves to surf maybe a little over the top but still brilliant i also love the smell of napalm in the morningthe plot is a fairly simple one and it doesnt take too much brainpower to figure out whats going on willards mission is to kill kurtz plain and simple but its the journey of the film that is really its heart and also the dire situations of war itself in the redux version we are forced to sit through the extended french plantation scene and the playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the films entirety other than it makes it a longer journey i dont feel they take away anything though its just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original through this journey the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in itin fact thats the entire point on top of that the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like kurtz to go completely mad a big war movie lover this one is up there with platoon and the deer hunter all of them classics i sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as i have had to go back on what ive said all three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the vietnam warso to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointlesseven if after having most recently view an i think its a tad better in the end apocalypse now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status its been given as a fellow reviewer has previously stated an is one of the most ambitious films ever made,positive
stmd is one of the most fun and enjoyable low budget films ive seen in quite some time director jeff smith who also served as co writer cinematographer and editor definitely shows his love of under appreciated s horror films with this movie anyone who loves the cheesiness preposterous situations wacky and stereotypical characters of s horror movies will definitely love this very tongue in cheek homage to the paststmd definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some it has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining s horror movies we all love i had a blast watching stmd from the s outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone i just couldnt get enough,positive
writer director robert downey sr a pioneer of the underground film movement in the s satirized the new york madison avenue advertising world with his avant garde comedy putney swope downey doesnt confine his ridicule to advertising but tackles black militant culture the dynamics in hollywoods portrayal of race the elite white power structure and character of corruption in any power struggle as audacious and ambitious as putney swope strives to be it qualifies as a terrible film amateurishly made on a shoe string budget with a no name cast and humor that lacks hilarity everything about this movie reeks with improvisation putney swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture like most marx brothers movies the plot is thin providing an excuse for downeys anecdotal gags most of which are terriblethe chairman of a prestigious madison avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting before the body has been removed the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member putney swope arnold johnson since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him swope pink slips all but one of the white executives surrounds himself with black pistol packing employees and renames the firm truth and soul advertising swope decides to alter the face of american advertising he refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol tobacco or war toys swopes clients stage an exodus after he becomes the ceo and grandstanding attracts a new line up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from swopes militant employees swope exploits his african american staff too ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns all of which are hailed as a new wave of marketing genius incredibly swopes conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue swopes advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security the high point of this black white minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color unfortunately downey doesnt know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome the funniest part of putney swope involves our eponymous protagonists dealings with us president mimeo in washington dc pepi hermine a marihuana toking midget with a kissinger like teutonic adviser larry wolf spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car the borman,negative
everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here this is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc slasher but without the passion that graced the originaltheres nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion the makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around although the actors werent exactly brilliant in demons in demons theyre actually a lot worse you dont care about these characters at all the plot is nonexistent the music poor apart from one simon boswell song its not scary in the least its just not that goodeasily the worst film dario argento has been involved with and lamberto bavas also bava has a cameo in this film not a very funny onemaybe is too high a rating but at least i could watch it all and didnt think of stopping midway my advice stick to the original,negative
more of a frisbee like turtle with fangs that go up like a wart hog more battles with people in bird suits that look like people in bird suits a ping pong ball space ship two naughty boys who know how to do everything including getting on board the space ship more tiresome music more gamera is the friend of children stuff i remember when godzill and rodan came out the movies were a lot of fun because the monsters were actually a threat to people now they are just a parade of silly costumes with very little behind them the adults are all ridiculous and moronic like in american sitcoms the kids are the bosses when in reality they couldnt think their way out of a paper bag these monster movies must be the japanese means of partonizing these little snots above all however is that after seeing three of these movies with the same plot over and over check the stock footage the ultimate conclusion is that they are boring if you havent see this one dont bother,negative
please re watch all series and do not go see this movie the trailer is completely misleading and the weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out min tv episode into the most painful hrs of my life truly an awful film tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins micky has line and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns also mr brisss accent just changes about times in the film tons of badly acted extras and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crapbatman and robin all is forgiven,negative
i cant really see how anyone can have any interest whatsoever in seeing this movie a woman meets a man he wants to play games she too but only until she realise what shes missing she leaves and thats it really it took weeks before elizabeth kim basinger left john mickey rourke she should have left him after minutes and ended our misery,negative
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film the fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences tells you that they have just enough the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendida must rent view or seedont be afraid of subtitlesits worth a little aversion therapy,positive
visually beautiful with some fine music this film otherwise has a fairly trite made for tv quality the romance between two characters which spans a cultural and educational divide is simply not plausible of course from early on we knew our persnickety heroine would lighten up win over the locals and find true love but that doesnt make it any less woeful that the movie had to take such completely expected turns this film had lots of promise which makes it more of a shame that the promise was unrealized perhaps a nice under the blanket on a cold night freebie on cable but i certainly wouldnt recommend paid rental or purchase im sure the soundtrack is wonderful though,negative
this movie is a rather odd mix of musical romance drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it its basically one messy heap of different genres of which none really works out like it was supposed tothis movie is an attempt by mickey rooney to be taken more serious as an actor hes a former child star who always used to star in in happy comical and musical productions at the start of his career in this movie he picks a different approach although the musical aspects are still present in the movie but his role is actually quite laughable within the movie i mean mickey rooney as a tough player hes an extremely small boyish looking man he actually was in his s already at the time of this movie but he seriously looks more like a year old hearing him say babe to women and hearing talking tough to gangsters who are about times bigger than he is just doesnt look and feel right he simply isnt convincing in his rolebecause the movie mixes so many different genres the story also really feels as a messy one somewhere in it there is a crime plot and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream but none of it works out really due to the messy approach and handling of it all it just isnt an interesting or compelling movie to watch lászló kardos is also a director who has done only movies in his lifetime despite the fact that his career span from till he must have been a struggling director who had a hard time getting work into the industry and instead once in a while was given a lesser script to work with his movies are all unknown ones and normally also not of too high qualitylets also not forget that this is a s movie but yet it more feels like a s one or perhaps even as one from the s this is of course mostly due to the fact that this movie got shot in black white generally speaking black white movies from the s often have a cheap looking feeling over it and this movie forms no exceptionits a rather strange sight seeing mickey rooney and louis armstrong and his band as themselves performing together in a sequence it wasnt the only movie armstrong appeared in though and he would often pop up in these type of movies often simply as himself i guess jazz lovers can still somewhat enjoy watching this movie due to its music since there is quite an amount of it present in this movie the movie actually received an oscar nomination for best original songan awkward little movie and outing from mickey rooney,negative
john travolta was excellent as michael in the movie by the same name i dont think a better portrayal could have been done the movie was funny yet touching michael is a very human angel if their is such andie macdowell is superb in her role as a reporter as she goes from disbelief to belief bill hurt and robert pastorelli are great as fellow reporters each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth each of the supporting cast is wonderful especially the older woman i do not know her screen name who plays michaels mother one of the cutest movies i have seen in years i could watch this movie dozens of times,positive
the monkees head is one of those peculiar phenomenons ive noticed that when something doesnt make sense people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings which its creator never intended such is the case herethe movie is a stream of consciousness spectacle of the monkees floating in and out of various sketches blackouts set pieces etc similar to the ones on their tv show but while the tv show was played for laughs this doesnt seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep trippy pseudo intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes all in all its the monkees doing the same schtick but now its consciousness raising because the laugh track is removed there is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing it just drones on with colored lightsthe music in head should prove to anyone beyond the shadow of a doubt that the monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability the tunes are mostly garbage the only one thats even listenable is porpoise song which opens and closes the film but the thing is that was a gerry goffin carole king song and while its above average for the monkees its below average by goffin and king standards its like hearing one of the old peter and gordon songs that paul mccartney wrote for them you might think its a pretty good song but then you find out who composed it and you realize its a throwaway mike nesmiths song is maybe passable the rest is worthless davy jones has i guess what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture since its the only song presented as show biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence but it falls flat too just because the song isnt any goodi have to admit i always liked the monkees so the movie is a real disappointment sure they were cheesy but they were so cheerful about itthey knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it but then they got ambitious in head they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product but the truth is they wanted something more they wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists maybe not like the beatles but something approaching that head proves that they failed on all counts out of,negative
although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast ice cream i scream is more like a caricature of sinceritythe plot opens with the dream of ali a traveling ice cream salesman in a western anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies he dreams of playing in his products tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him as his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for years with no apparent reason is it because he is not successful in his job apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies but this is what he says we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling ice cream to the people in the town ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzyin a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town in search of his stolen bike ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously annoyed by the nagging of his wife ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk one of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wakes up and prevents him an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life according to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing when he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much ice cream they confess to the doctor that they stole alis bike ali forgives them and there comes the happy endalthough the plot may look promising in a way its the story telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art even alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice cream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft and when his motorbike is found it solves every problem ali becomes a happy and powerful husband not a real criticism of globalismsecond the film is cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars or to have a political message if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a mans big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny,negative

the first thing you should know about zipperface is that it was shot on video so it has that peculiar home video ish look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a real film and zipperface indeed looks as if a bunch of amateurs got together for an attempt at a real serial killer thriller its not quite that but its not as bad as it looks either having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre dona adams gives an appealingly amateurish performance in the role her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her plus she puts up a great fight against the killer at the end the red herrings appear ludicrous at first but ultimately they work i guessed the killer incorrectly and you have to wonder if perhaps tarantino had seen the zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of the gimp for pulp fiction,negative
golden boy is ecchi humor bordering on hentai in the guise of educational moments the main character kintaro wanders around getting himself into the silliest situations involving women its just that hes shy on the surface but analyses everything until he can learn something from it the most striking feature of the series are the circumstances surrounding his education which are outright embarrassing yet funny at the same time,positive
too bad mike meyers picked this for his dramatic debut this film looks like it was put together by a committee that couldnt decide if it was a comedy drama suspense or sci fi it starts out sort of playful then quickly gets darker and then at the end apparently shortly after one of the main characters has been killed the whole family is standing in the backyard laughing about something its totally weird and impossible to string together the acting is extremely uneven with the older professionals engaging your attention and then the younger and less experienced actors looking like they are in a high school play this movie showed me that its probably harder to make a good movie than is evident from the truly professional fare we see in the first run and art houses this would be a good film for a film class to analyze plot character theme consistency they are all either faulty or missing from this film,negative
the worst movie i have ever seen the sound quality was bad the cutting of the scenes was even worse and above all it was not logic and it had no speedi first tought oh no i dont want the trail that proves that poor patrick was an innocent killer but this turned out to be even worse typically in this american film you get a super hint or no hints at all i want very tiny small hints that direct you to the killer the audience isnt involved and now when i dont get any hints at all you can expect a several s he is the killer sweeps in the end and that is not all ah this is hopeless lets make an end to itin one word disgusting,negative
those who love the book jane eyre as i do its my all time favorite and i re read it at least once a year will love this version timothy dalton is just a tad too good looking to be mr rochester but other than that he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of thornfield zelah clarke may have been just a little too old to play the year old jane but when i watch this movie i dont think about the ages of the characters the dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book which was very smart sure this film might seem a little long but its the only version ive seen that includes part of the storyi wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer zeferelli version as it would have helped that mess of a filmi also realized the last time i watched this video that judy cornwell plays aunt reed she is so versatile that i didnt recognize her she plays daisy in keeping up appearances and also played mrs musgrove in s persuasion another wonderful adaptionupdate got the dvd this week and its marvelous to see the original unedited version theres lots more at the beginning young jane at gateshead and at lowood and at the end theyve restored lots of things i always wondered why st john had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who jane is because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the us vhs version rosamund oliver is in itshe was completely cut out of the vhs as far as i could tell they hadnt edited out any of timothy daltons parts so nothing new there but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the vhs thanks bbc psi would have paid more for a special edition dvdwith maybe some interviews with the starsor a making of show,positive

this film is about a mysterious love letter that turned peoples love life upside downthe idea of the film is interesting and the film could have been funny however this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be the characters are inadequately introduced at first so it gets so confusing the supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air the pacing is awfully slow that it makes minutes seem more like minutesit could have been romantic and funny but this film spectacularly failed to do either,negative

a very bizarre bringing to the screen of william shakespeares tragic love storythe que family and the capulet family have a long running hatred of one another which often results in violence the hatred has something to do with a film company and the fact that everyone is pretty much crazy in the middle of all of this insanity are tromeo and juliet literatures most famous star crossed lovers that fall for each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize whose family the other belongs tothe film follows the basic plot of the original play remarkably well and key scenes even use the original or close to original lines but the infamous troma bizarreness pervades the film from beginning to end that makes for a movie that is definitely not for all tastes but it is nonetheless pretty inventive tyrone tybalt in shakespeare has a particularly funny death scene many differently edited and rated versions exist each contains violence profanity drug use and sex all with a big dose of bizarreness,positive
just imagine the real hitler who was a master of propaganda and speech would have been such a mumbling moron as carlyle portrayed him in this filmnobody would have followed him not even a desperate unemployed guy in the sthis is just a hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself disguised as true historyi pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show carlyle and the producers didnt get anything right with thiswhy was hitler able to win so many people a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage why did people follow him to death by portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable this film is a mixture of old ww propaganda and mtv urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century imagine a film about churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for mins this film is a disgrace and i wonder how they could talk an actor like carlyle into this dreck,negative

as seems to be the general gist of these comments the film has some stunning animation i watched it on blu ray but it really falls short of any real depthfirstly the characters are all pretty dull i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito toola and the main antagonist shunack however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking laputa being my favourite animé original engilsh dub the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected she loves agito who seems oblivious of this however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy there is also a serious lack of explanation like who are the druids really are they people and who are the weird women girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffidsand who does call toola why bother with this if it wont be explainedi really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadnt bought it my advice give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap perhaps if your new to animé films and dont have much to go by you will enjoy it it certainly is visually pleasing,negative
i had high hopes for this film when i saw the listing and decided to watch it on tv uninterrupted by commercial breaks ive liked lee van cleef in many movies but im afraid that having the other characters call him chris repeatedly doesnt turn him into even a reasonable facsimile of yul brenners chrisi found this movie to be a complete disappointment the music sound track tried to impart the magnificence portrayed in the original but it too failed to bring the film up the the standard of the original the rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film i guess if you havent seen the original it would be okay too many clichés and too little depth to the characters i missed the humanity and compassion and the three dimensional characters of the original,negative

first of all i believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read joseph conrads heart of darkness the book that was the literary basis for the movie with that said i believe that this movie is astounding it is an excellent war film that doesnt so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the vietnam conflict but more the psychological toll that it took on the young inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it coppola showed real genius in the art of film making using many visuals to help tell the story the acting i felt was definitely all around up to par marlon brandos part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting his elucidation to willard at the end of the film reels you in and reveals the hollowness of a man that youve heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all in my opinion this is one of the most sculptured and best made films of all time,positive
usually i know after the first minute of a movie if i will hate it or adore it but now i was wrongthe start was great the this is based on a true story and blah blah blah thing was funny after the cartoons and the description of the guys life with pictures made me think i had made the right choicethen seeing the hilarious fake look of toronto was cool also the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first ideathat was maybe the first minutes of the movie which afterwards looked like an eternitymaybe thats just me not understanding english canadian humour thats possible english canadians also do not always understand quebecois humour but hey there was enough stuff in that for a short movie nothing more maybe that could be a meaning for the title anyway almost everything was filling and very few things were even close to funny in my opinionas a matter of fact the making of was better than the movie at least you understand the motivation behind that which made everything bad the potential of the idea was great thats why i rented the movie being interested in the annoying people disappearance thing but yet i did not know the whole universe would vanish and with it even a point to the movieif you are english canadian it seems you could appreciate the local humour considering the surprising number of people who gave this movie an otherwise just think twice before losing your precious time,negative
i am probably a little too old for this movie and being a guy the story is a little too girlie but i really thought it was a cool movie overall all the girls in this movie are so hot and really great actresses from alana to adrianne to deena to kimberly all the way down to the cute girl that plays alanas little sister rachel i am not a huge pop star fan with the lovesick songs but i thought that aaron carter did a really great job in this and seems like he was really into this movie and made it seem real my mom liked all the older farts that she grew up with so thats cool too i kept thinking that i liked a lot of the people and wonder if i will see them again a sequel would be cool i rented this but i might buy it too since i have a ton of dvds and like to go back to see something that i missed i couldnt buy it at blockbuster though so i dont know where i could buy it right now but ill look into that anyway i am a year old guy i already said that i know but i would totally take a date to see this its really good for all ages really i think even my little half sister who is could see this thats what is so cool about it that it is something that all ages can see im sure that was done on purpose but it really works girls can dream about being with aaron carter and guys like me can dream about all the hot chicks in this movie there is something for everyone,positive

i rented this movie primarily because it had meg ryan in it and i was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one not only is she not on screen much but nothing her character does is essential to the plot her character could be written out of the story without changing it much,negative
although it may not be cassavetes best work minnie and moskowitz is almost perfect in all its endeavours the plot is whimsical and charming and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive range of emotion much more drama than comedy contrary to imdbs profile yes the story is whimsical but not arbitrary it succeeds as believable albeit a tad forced which i will come back to all of the artistic aspects are of true cassavetes form the cinematography and camera work are delights and the soundtrack albeit barely there is complimentary plus i believe i noticed some nods to godard and such in the editing as i have in a few of cassavetes other films namely the abrupt cutting of a song in one scene which are interestingi feel the plot is built up nicely with the first half being particularly enjoyable seymours conversation with morgan morgan timothy carey in the diner for example is wonderfully funny and fascinating and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film this philosophising a tradition in cassavetes films is what made the film for me seymours amusing and profound monologues instantly eliminate the first impressions one may have of him as a hippie simp though his character is curiously similar to that of his in faces this tipped me however on second viewing into the opinion that it stands up against cassavetes best work i gained an affection for this film that i lacked on first viewingthere are sadly several aspects that make this film imperfect i find the plot to be unbalanced as i said before it builds up nicely but it wanes a bit here and there particularly towards the end because of the spontaneous style in which cassavetes worked and particularly the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise the quality of his product can easily go either way in this case its inconsistent i assess that most of this film was improvised and most of it beautifully but one or two scenes unfortunately just dont work in particular the scene after seymour fights with minnies work associate outside her house during what is intended to be the most intense scene of the film cassavetes allowed his actors to run free with the dialogue presuming some was planned beforehand this i believe was a mistake one gets the impression cassel doesnt quite know what to do as he repeatedly fumbles in his speech often not making sense and overacts all of this damaging the scene and the character development i understand seymour is intended to be a bit of a brash fool but cassels attempts here are misapplied why does he cut his moustache off these flaws are resulting from a lack of direction on cassavetes part a lack of understanding and forethought on cassels part a lack of rehearsal and preparation etc evidently cassavetes didnt learn from his mistakes as he allowed this same thing to happen in his next film a woman under the influence the committing scene and endingthe flaws i mention are not minor but they do not ruin the film they simply make some scenes cringe worthy and unrealistic spoiling the flow of the film and compromising its potential however i am very very fond of cassavetes and all of his actors particularly cassel in spite of the faults i mentioned this is a very enjoyable film although it proves the precariousness of cassavetes style,positive

jean marc barr being light the big blue dogville has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy i might be wrong but i dont think this movies part of the dogma manifesto though it really looks like it im not really sure of what i think about this film all actors are good they deliver pretty good performances especially rosanna arquette and jean marc barr the story is somehow interesting but i dont know theres something about the movie that i dont like the sex scenes are way too long it goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap i dont know exactly where it stands sure its not a bad movie but i wont suggest people to see it neither ill tell them not to watch just do as you want if you feel curious and youre open minded give it a try you might like it,negative
its hard to criticize this movie because i dislike the story itself and no amount of good acting would have saved it think raising arizona with a mean streak the acting is passable but jennifer tilly is way over the top yet not enough to make this a nice camp film as usual coming in somewhere between misery and a sarcastic dmv employee the rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise a real degrading few hours of film darryl hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood i wish i could tell you how it ended but i walked out sorry,negative

one of my desires is to be a film maker and i just have to say theres no way i will be able to compete with the powerful drama the war at home the reason is because the acting is perfect and when you see the movie youll know what im talking about all i can suggest is watching it i got so involved in it and was extremely impressedestevezs and sheens relationship on the screen was absolutely amazingand so was his relationship with his mother kathy bates some of the best scenes include these as well as the relationship between sheen and his daughter estevezs sister in the film and definitely in my top i want the dvd,positive
the secret of kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the book of kells an illuminated manuscript from the middle ages featuring the four gospels of the new testament i didnt know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier there are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over years this is one of themwe are introduced to brendan an orphan who lives at the abbey of kells in ireland with his uncle abbot cellach voiced by brendan gleeson abbot cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks they are more focused on reading and writing something abbot cellach does not have time for anymore he fears the northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the groundone day a traveler comes from the island of iona near scotland it is brother aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished abbot cellach grants him permission to stay and brendan buddies up with him aidan has special plans for brendan first he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries the only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to brendan seeing that he is the only chance for aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absencein the forest brendan meets ashley the protector of the forest she allows brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company she warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it there are things worse than vikings out there from there brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasioni like the story a lot more now that i know what it is about knowing now what the book of kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense im sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages much like the opening frames of disneys the sword in the stone the animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns it creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each otheri couldnt take my eyes off of the incredible detail this is some of the finest d animation i have seen in years its vibrant stimulating and full of life the characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around it enhances the filmthe story is satisfactory although i think the ending could have been strung out a little more with a runtime of only minutes i think there could have been something special in the final act it doesnt give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book we are reminded of its importance but never fully understand we are told that it gives hope but never why or how that was really the only lacking portion of the film otherwise i thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animationi guess thats okay to a certain degree the animation can carry a film so far before it falls short the story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history i would recommend looking up briefly the book of kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about i think it will help your viewing experience a lot more this a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed,positive
a town in japan is being taken over by a horribly brutal abstract shape the spiral its becoming a theme in everything from animals to clouds to people and twisting them mentally and literally this film shows it happening to several groups of people some demonic possession is implied but nothing is entirely sure except that the best bet is to get the heck out of dodge the film progresses really well from normal life to abnormal phenomena giant snails and crazy people to the truly supernatural walking deadas a jaded american horror movie fan this was just what i needed maybe it was just the novelty of a different cultures film but it seemed to have a very original progression set of characters and the premise was definitely new the japanese may think horror shapes uzumaki means spiral im told are old by now but it was nice for me because im used to monster alien virus disaster undead films in an american movie you know whos going to die the annoying nasty lascivious racist characters and who will live the children heroine dogs cats nice guy thats not true in japanese horror it was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end up also it had this really new but probably typically japanese color leached pacific northwest style cloudy day thing going which was a fresh visual effect for me the horrific moments were seriously creepy relying on a little gore but mainly just impossibly overdone facial expressions think the ring and body manipulations this should be one of the greats up there with once original ideas like the first nightmare on elm street or night of the living dead,positive
think of a no budget version of china syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes john woo and youll get power play the idea was good but the execution acting and dialog absolutely killed it not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the moviethis is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake the rather cavalier reporter going up against what shouldve been a more ruthless bunch of company execs is chased around town along with anyone he speaks to in order to clean whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plants faultsunfortunately there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting not to mention the viewer who may only be attracted to the movie for its action genre appeal is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em ups plus earthquake disaster scenes all of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that shouldve propelled the story it mightve been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story creepy villains a naive reporter and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong doing afoot it is formulaic but at least it wouldve been entertaining,negative
so tell me what serious boozer drinks budweiser how many suicidally obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboys bachelor pad bar would be proud to boast and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriends tits with it just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shues assetscage seems to be portraying the most attention seeking look at me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street walker she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings skin lacerations anal rape and graphic verbal abuse all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the tart with a heartstill i did watch it to the end by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shues tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly pathetically smiling while cage all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake grimaced and mugged his way through the final half hour,negative
the biggest national lampoon hit remains animal house and rightly so it was funny raucous and good naturedthe exact opposite of every other national lampoon film including class reunionplease do not be fooled by the inclusion of stephen furst flounder from animal house or by the fact that john hughes wrote this jumbled mess this reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painfulone star and thats being generous then again i always thought most of my old classmates were demons vampires and serial killers too,negative
the first time i saw this film i wanted to like it for so many reasons but i simply did not it just seemed a little dull but there was a tiny question i had about something i saw near the beginning of the film so i watched it again and then finally it clicked for me i first watched the movie knowing the surprise ending and while i definitely wouldnt recommend having the ending spoiled for you i have still thoroughly enjoyed the bulk of the film and discovering the many seemingly insignificant events that all unravel to point to a very sinister schemei dont think that everyone will love this movie or even like it if you like any of the actors youll like this movie because the acting is fairly strong and they all get a lot of screen time if you like mysteries namely hitchcock youll like this movie if you like independent or psychological films youll like this movie it really worked for me on all of those levels if you dont like the actors mysterious plots or psychological elements you might not like this movie but thats your loss personally the only thing that irked me a little was the accents good try alan rickman on the american dialect but it wasnt much improvement from the scene in die hard the wonderful voice makes up for the weird accent though the medley of accents in the movie was a little odd but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly irritating also the camera change from scene to scene was evident and might bother some people but i actually think it added to the scenes or scene i can really only recall one scene where the change was severely different but it workedwhen you see this movie see it at least twice the second time you see it i hope you realize how intricate the plot really is every time i watch this movie its under an hour and a half so multiple viewings are not difficult i seem to notice something else about it and find myself wondering why did that just happen or was that intentional i like movies that make me think this one does so just see it twice,positive

the make or break of a love story for me is whether or not i like the characters and also if they click with each other matt is pretty unlikeable aloof braggart seemingly lazy and a misogynist hes been hurt badly by his dysfunctional mom and this makes him a little easier to take i guess i liked the details of his dysfunction he was believable he overcompensates by bragging that hel nail amy he acts so cool around amy that he strikes out twice when they do talk he cant show her who he really is she empathizes and then stonewalls him at just the right moments she seems so mature and strong that the traits of hers that come out later didnt seem to fit for me i found her to be incredibly sexy and pretty girl next door pretty i call it so i was going to like this movie unless it really screwed upfunny things happen with the coach but matts relationship with the other coach was inspiring the football scenes at the end were perplexing matt doesnt carry the ball but seems to be a blocking back folks he isnt the right size hes fifty pounds too light for that position but i thought his acting was skilled i measure that by the way i wanted to wring his neck a couple of times during his scenes with meredith monroe the film was all right meredith m was better than all right,positive
look as being anglo irish i assure you this reviewer is anything but bias but i assure you this is very much an irish film and not english as the last comment seems to have suggested this film was written by neil jorden and conor mcpherson and directed by conor mcpherson too both irish the cast is almost entirely irish it was shot in ireland with an irish crew even michael gambon was born in ireland i remember him joking about it in an interview about this filmmichael cane was evidently brought in to boost box office takings abroadloved the film i just wanted to correct a totally uninformed commentnow on with the review i loved dylan moran have always been a fan of his himself and michael cane formed a surprisingly good double act it was great to see morans range as an actor as he plays several different made up characters during the film i would recommend this film to anyone with an interest in comedy as it represents a fresh quirky and inventive turn in irish feature length chuckle films i laughed a lot what more could you ask for,positive
i dont remember this film getting a cinema release over here i only saw it when it came onto cable the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines specifically one person the way he gets replaced and dumped literally into an off world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feelsseems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space and would have been happy if it wasim certainly happy it wasnt kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple the scene where hes sitting outside the compound shows this albeit the decision for two slow mo replays detracts from the momentthis is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner alien silent running logans run or thx were however it is unfortunately the nearest ive seen to it in a long timehe changes in the movie to a believable degree he doesnt crack arnie one liners he doesnt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy endingthats why this film didnt do well it didnt follow formula and among a year old target american audience thats unforgivable as it was wasnt what they expected to seefear and disciplinealways,positive
this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers gershwin and a nice parisien atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story well its not really there or at least not very well worked out the acting is also not so smooth by caron but i liked some of the dialogues i liked the scene at the seine i liked the character played by levant the colors and the dancing of course which is quite magnificenta seems on the dot to me,positive

i dontknow maybe its because im brazilian but all that stuff was too much too much love for the music too much parties too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters come on its not so sad and the aspect of the city shown by the director everything looks too fake to me the families the relationships the music the happiness it simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture i must be honest it did seduce me a little but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music sex and parties im not that stupid what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea profound sadness and stds i liked the scene with caridads mother phone call and the discussion about the contract with all the musicians and the spanish people,negative

fay grim is the continuation of a story begun ten years earlier with hartleys henry fool i havent seen the earlier film and i dont know if thats a good thing or not i can only regard the current film on its own meritsfor most people hal hartleys style of film making is something that you either like or you dont his combination of action drama absurdity and dry ironic humour really resonates with me and fay grim is no exception it has an air of sharply written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan straightness its a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood pumps out like pancakesduring the second half of the film the humour starts to thin as the film morphs into an international espionage conspiracy thriller whether this was hartleys intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear but i think a bit of editing or re writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have maintained the films original momentumthe performances were generally good particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum who had the most screen time saffron burrows james urbaniak carl montgomery and elina lwensohn all played good support roles the films visuals were nice set in new york paris berlin and istanbul and the music also by hartley was good without being intrusive the film is well written and i enjoyed this it immensely if you like hartleys earlier work youll probably like this,positive
voor een verloren soldaat for a lost soldier is a sad example of how not to translate to film a touching complex psychological study of that most magical time in a mans life when he is still a child but starting to become a man the novel records the real life experiences of rudy van dantzig as told thru the boy jeroen during the waning days of wwii at age as he deals with his incipient sexuality and his deep fears of abandonment as he has been sent to the province of friesland north of holland by his parents because of the lack of food in amsterdam and has not heard from them in many months as the postal service has broken down the arrival of the liberating soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully corny way with the soldiers providing entertainment vaudeville style then one soldier walt romances jeroen and the pair is presented as two frolicking maleswho consummate their love in a sexual experience this taken in stride by the yo jeroen the reality was somewhat different jeroen describes his encounters with walt in all in detail but in oblique language but there is no misunderstanding their nature walt is aroused to an intense passion by jeroen during which he handles him roughly so that in their final meeting jeroen is bruised and suffering a painful wound on the shoulder where walt has bitten him during this encounter walt rapes jeroen twice jeroen could have easily avoided walt after their nd encounter when walt first assaults him as walt is clearly anxious to keep his abuse of the boy from the other soldiers why jeroen keeps seeking walt out is a mystery of the human heart and not explainable by me anyway what the film leaves out is the aftermath the nightmares the dejection the frantic search throughout amsterdam on the chance of finding walt for jeroen loved walt and nothing could shake that,negative
i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night ive been a fan of tolkiens work for about years now ever since i got out of high school i didnt grow up on this movieperhaps my mother kept me away from it its definitely not for children not that its bad in a graphic sense but that the themes would go right over most year olds heads overall the animation was excellent considering this was made in i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense but i am bothered that bashki didnt just add another minutes or so and tack on the return of the king parts that wouldve made it the ultimate movie i was bothered by its abrupt end and then when i heard return of the king sucked i was bothered even more too bad it wasnt one great animation film it might have garnered a higher vote from me i give it a i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr,positive
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early th century he is a true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such a beautiful woman its her love that makes rob roy the legend but its his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but its unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if youre not used to a scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes its their skill as actors that attracts you they dont rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special,positive

i had just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this tv adaptation which was broadcast on the hallmark channel on monday night the key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth but i watched for an hour out of and i saw the man with the steel teeth but i never saw him steal a manifesto i saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book its too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast but isnt the idea of turning a book into a movie tv or film to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience they only kept me for an hour i thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise this book had a great mcguffin to paraphrase hitchcock but they ignored it and it said in the titles that forsyth was involved in the production they sure must have paid him a lot of money,negative
its great to hear the or so comments that point out what footballers wives signifies for women the title alone washes away any supposed equality women have in the media industry or society reducing them to two dimensional cartoon caricatures of how men think women should behave it is a post modern moronic farce it might as well be called footballers wifey who stays at home and knows her placeon one hand it could actually be some sort of parody on the uks gutter trash press representation of celebrities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society so women can undermine stereotypes by acting like those stereotypes and own the image that has been created for them by mens desire nah that would be to ironic and clever i also sound like i should be praising itzoe lucker is simply too camp and over the top to be taken seriously just like an even cheaper cruella de ville she just needs some maniacal condescending yet at the same time self appraising laugh to show off her true acting range oh she does right anyway it just about sums up whom this is aimed at either clever clever journos who think its an up roaring send up of vaudevillian proportions or people who think its real finest actors omg stop watching this afterbirth of a pantomime and get a lifeits utterly sexist and is of such low quality that maybe those who enjoy it think they are in on the joke do the actors really care or understand what they are communicating its so demeaning to women and men they are not all self centred selfish football loving materialistic jerks who think women are nothing but another trophy to be put on display for the public its so humiliating i am sure ms lucker would easily stand up to them in her real life and twist them round her finger as so easily done in footballers wives but of course its doesnt really matter i mean its only a tv programme after all so please let it stay axed its dreadful and will only be looked back on in the same disbelief that prisoner cell block h was so fondly remembered forhow did it come to exist it sure aint subtle or complex it could only come from the same mind set who read fhm magazine and think its alright to look at soft porn and do as many women who bow to their will and chant patriotic and racist comments whenever their football team losses wins its totally crass,negative
i bought this film on dvd so i could get an episode of mystery science theater thankfully mike crow and tom servo are watchable because the film itself is not although there is a plot a story one can follow and a few actors that can act there isnt anything else the movie was so boring i have firmly confirmed that i will never watch it again without tom crow and mike as summarized above however it was better than the film featured in the mstk episode that preceded it mitchell,negative
i recently stumbled across a tv showing of passion having missed the opening scenes ms currier in to be praised for having the vision and courage to bring such a strange de balzac tale to the screen i am grateful to the entire cast and crew for their parts in producing such a thoroughly fine motion picture it must have been arduous shooting so many scenes in the desert and i cannot comprehend how her trainer coaxed such a fine performance from the leopard simoon this adverture calls to mind another suspenseful adventure naked prey why isnt this film more well known hope i can find it on video,positive
reading some of the other reviews of this film i was reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it but overall i have to say it is one of the better films i have seen from any number of genres or countries recently more than anything else it avoided many of the typical traps of more recent international cinema like taking nice pictures of landscapes or being hip fun or imitating american films like pulp fiction the film is unique in many ways for one thing it is a film about relationships in which sex plays no role unusual especially for foreign films it is also a film about two mens relationship to each other also unusual not a buddy film no homosexual tension no ego phallic competition it uses little dialogue but communicates a tremendous amount it is a simple story yet full of complex details which are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance i did not find the film dark or depressing everything would seem this way if you watch hollywood happy ending films all the time but rather a true reflection of human emotions for instance in the scene where mahmut realizes his cousin is gone is you see both his feeling of relief that the cousin is gone and yet regret that he pushed him away who has not felt such ambivalence when losing a friend or lover or in some other situation its rare to get these kinds of real human emotions displayed on film in a non cliché way as far as culture is concerned or this being a turkish film i feel it strikes the very difficult balance between being a turkish film about realities which more apply to that place the greater struggle to make it in a turkish city versus a european one the greater contrast between country and city and a universal human story which didnt necessarily have to be set in turkey in this day and age where people around the world are consuming culture and fetishizing it this film does not try to entice us as turkish nor does it try to communicate it as a harsh reality or thats how turkey istanbul is and yet the cultural elements are there i think the comparison to lost in translation that somebody made is quite good everyone at least in the us was raving about that film i personally thought it was mediocre at best it was well put by someone as a vague story which supposedly was supposed to deal with disorientation that happens to people living or traveling overseas even if the film was supposed to be humorous the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear even for a lighter film or comedy this is necessary and i found myself being treated to a typically orientalist story of the alienated amerian overseas going back to distant as for the idea that this is bad acting or too slow or has no plot im sorry but people who say this know nothing about film making and maybe nothing about being human no offense you do not have to be a film aficionado or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this film this film will be two hours of your time well spent,positive
my husband brought this home from the video store so i could watch something while stuck home sick the sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book but a sorta silly light romantic flick sounds just right that and a bowl of chicken soup well he meant wellmy first thought as some others post here also was that the house must be fakeits not only isolated alone on the beach but set on moorings into the loose sand and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house this looks so obviously dangerous in hurricane country in the fall so potentially disastrous that i was sure filmmakers had simply cgid the whole thing or used movie magic to plunk a cute bb into the surfbut i have to tell you guys thanks to teh interwebs i can say that the house serendipity is very real is indeed near rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs appears mostly as it does in the film you can rent it yourself off season for a week or about in summer go for it butinterestingly the house has severe problems the second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the plumbing electrical in that surf and sure enough serendipity was condemned for a break in the sanitation caused by overwash from the ocean they are rebuildingand the house isnt from the civil war not to mention that viola davis playing cliché black best friend thankless role for a fine actress last seen in doubt is not remotely old enough that her grandmother could have built anything in the civil war hello that was years ago try great great great in reality serendipity was built in laughably recently the basic film is built on a typical nicholas sparks weeper which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance it is also aimed in a very pandering way towards women you know us women who love bbs fusty antiques and knick knackswho dream of romance and guys who look like richard gere and dancing in the moonlight dont give us plot or thoughtful character development just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenesgere plays a plastic surgeon who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek of course she died of an overdose of anesthesia so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist hello where is that guy why is the wrong doctor feeling guiltygere has come to pout and confront the womans husband and is staying at the remote bbwho should be there why the only other person in the inndiane lane shes a lonely divorcée with rotten kids and an ex hubby who wants her back while shes trying to decide about that the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the bbnow in the real world if this set up ever even happened the doctor would look like ernest borgnineand the lonely divorcée like rosie odonnell hed spend his vacation horndogging year old girls on the beach while she sulked and thought about going on a diet but this isnt the real world i digressthe couple confess all fall in love a hurricane hitsthey make love fall in love he has to go away he dies and she cries a lot about that the endthere ive saved you from it now you dont have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances husbands sons boyfriends from sitting through this tripe very wearyingsomeone else asked why diane lane a perfect tiny woman whom filmmakers seem to love to cast because shes just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her but shes ish and not over the top so she isnt threatening is constantly covered in big tarp like shawls this would make sense if she was chubby but she isntanyways someone throw a pretty paisley shawl over this film so we dont have to watch it conclusion read a book unless you are too sick if too sick go to sleep,negative
a longtime fan of bette midler i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads a literal rainbow of emotion and talent bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire as well as new songs from the bette of roses album spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around,positive
never i have seen a movie so terrible that ive gone insane it was a huge waste of time seeing this crappy film there are a lot of things i hate about this movie the songs is so terrible yet a little bit catchy i hit my head on the wallespecially from the song grandpa is gonna sue the pants out of santa which i hit times shrugs the character design and that evil greedy and bitchy cousin meli cannot stand her for one second she has got to be one of the most bitchiest person ive seen even though i kinda like her southern voice the only bright side is that austin bucks is played by the person who is the voice of liquid snake from metal gear solidi would not recommended to people to watch for the holidays as it was a huge disgrace for x mas,negative
although the notorious bettie page is well acted and shot is is at best a cliffs notes version of betties biography the film mainly centers on her work with irving and paula klaw the brother and sister team who produced the bulk of her most famous photos it does not detail her life after posing aside from her religious rebirth it cites the real bettie page by richard foster as a source but it ignores betties later years of mental illness and incarceration in a mental hospital the narrow focus of the biography can be debated but the majority of betties fans and the civilians would probably be more interested in her modeling career which is what they getthe film is well acted with gretchen mol faithfully reproducing the look of bettie as well as conveying the sweetness that her photos exuded the character is played as rather naive a probable byproduct of interviews given by bettie in recent years it is more likely that bettie was aware of the nature of her photos but rationalized it as acting and costumesthe supporting cast is also outstanding with chris bauer and lili taylor playing irving and paula klaw and david strathairn as estes kefauver the film errs with the character of john willie played by jared harris john willie never met bettie page and was not involved in photo shoots with the klaws harris plays willie a bit like peter otoole in his more debauched statedespite the quality of acting the film is a bit of a disappointment in terms of depth the story is rather cursory and we never feel that we truly get to know bettie much like her photos its just an image it does tend to exaggerate betties notoriety her photos were mainly seen in and around new york in a very narrow market of underground and cultish publications her real fame came after her photos were reprinted in the late s and s and the cult of betty page as her name was usually spelled grew betties greatest exposure pardon the pun was in playboy appearing in the january issue the christmas photo which is staged in reverse in the filmthe film is well done if rather shallow it is able to sustain interest until the end and showcases many fine performances it hits the high points of betties life but ignores many details which would have given it far greater depth the ending is rather a let down it feels rather abrupt still the movie is definitely worth viewing by anyone interested in bettie or even the time period the soundtrack is great really pulling the viewer into the s if nothing else the film stands as a showcase for americas burgeoning sexuality and the clash with its puritan past its also a peek at an icon for both men and women,positive
a lack of character development proves fatal for this movie valeria golinos character grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal the other characters are thin probably the writers fault not the actors the only exception is filippo pucillo as the younger son filippo his energy and bravado are funny and convincingi suppose the childrens petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town but for me the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way for example when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show the pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie,negative
john travolta reprises his role as chili palmer hollywood gangster who now turns his eye to the music business using his negotiation skills he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by uma thurman and try to get his young singer christina milian a hit recordbefore i saw this sequel i had heard that it was a terrible film however be cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if its not as good as the original the movie focuses on the music industry this time around instead of the movie industry the music business is portrayed very poorly in the movie and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes i cant tell if this was the intention or not since get shorty did a nice job of spoofing the movie industry the same cant be said for the sequel and the attempts just come as lazyan impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking the best performance is given by the rock and its nice to see him in a different type of role vince vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end surprisingly uma thurman gives an average performance and i was expecting more from her john travolta returns as chili and he does an okay job his performance is kind of dull though christina milian gives a horrible performance and shes also not that good of a singer cedric the entertainer gives a good performance though he isnt in the film for very long there are also a bunch of cameos including steven tyler and james woodf gary gray directs and he does a poor job he just doesnt handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess there was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile also at minutes the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots the film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasnt fortunately for the film the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes sometimes the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny compared to the original the sequel doesnt measure up well however be cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy in the end be cool is worth a rental and thats it rating,negative
one minute into the untold and its already ripped off techniques from the blair witch project and predator does this mean well be seeing lots of trees we sure will will we be seeing an austrian bodybuilder blowing things up well this film has the budget of a tvm so the answer is a resounding no does anyone like these soft porn shows like bedtime stories good because theres a scene in this that resembles these type of shows unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite do you like it when the screen fades to black during a tvm great because this happens between every scene in the untold in fact it happens during every scene too did you enjoy millionaire a major fraud fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major charles ingram the contestant who tried to swindle the show out of one million pounds seriously one of the characters looks like major ingram i kept expecting him to say its bear it could be a bear but it might be a bigfoot yes its a bigfoot its definately a bigfoot yes im going to shoot it final answer chris oh and have i mentioned that all the above are the good bits the untold isnt the worst bigfoot movie ive ever seen that accolade firmly goes to night of the demon which i saw over twenty years ago and i think ive only seen less than a dozen films that are worse in all of that time but that said the untold is still a very poor film in just about every aspect especially editing as some other reviewers have pointed out it feels like whole chunks of the film are missing while theres other bits where scenes are spliced together in the wrong order this is a really bad film that deserves far less than its rating of i give it out of ten and im being very kind,negative

end game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things were happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldnt make sense without it the whole story could have been told in about minutes it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job consideringthe end game was honestly one of the worst films ive ever seenand thats saying something ive seen gigli,negative

curse of michael myers is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the halloween series after a very disappointing letdown in halloween the series reached a near ebb in plot lines with a silly devolution into witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of michael myers curse of michael myers ups the ante in blood and gore but really represents a decay in the series integrity its too bad to as this is the last movie for donald pleasance as the character of dr loomis pleasance has some good screen moments precious ones if your a fan of the series as the now very aged and as he says very retired doctor sadly he died before the movie was completed and it is very apparent at the conclusion of the film that the stories original climatic scene was never realized right from the beginning credits halloween has more of the feel of a made for tv movie then that of the block buster horror flick that it started out as in any loyal halloween alumni should have demanded more from this film dr loomis and donald pleasance deserved more,negative
this movie is based mainly on the emotions and interactions of people there are only three locations the school the store and the coachs house that are really used its primarily at the coachs house however a movie doesnt need special effects or amazing views to be amazing in itselffour friends who had bonded during their basketball days meet up one is rich important and has no real love outside of money one wants to be mayor again but his competition is turning him sour one wants to be superintendent of the school and take care of his family one is a traveling alcoholicfirst off i love the actors in this film theyve all been household names to me they proved their worth hereone of the most pivotal moments is when tom played by gary sinise blows up on the coach he yells and rants about how the coach cheated in the winning game his blows the coachs whistle and yells back his catchphrases forgive me father for i have sinned its amazing to watch with energy that just chills youhighly recommended to anyone who understands human emotion and doesnt need shiny effects to interest them,positive
this tftd episode from season one titled ironically answer me is a pretty well done and memorable episode and it takes a shocking twist at the end you have jean marsh as an over the hill and washed up actress from la whos moved to new york city for an audition and shes living in an apartment provided by an old friend oddly every night shes kept awake by a ringing phone from the next door apartment yet oddly enough the dwelling where the ringing phone continues to ring is unoccupied as the guests have been dead for many years finally she has to give in only she should have followed along and not answered the phone with no one home as its bad to get wrapped up in a phone with a life of its own overall good episode a strange one though about a supernatural phone still its suspenseful and it twists well at the end,positive
as other viewers have mentioned this film was an interesting experiment in photography the colors are comic book bold i think the director got carried away with his artistic vision over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content despite its stellar cast the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre release press a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album im breathless music inspired by the film dick tracy which was a stratospheric hit due in large part to the inclusion of dance hit vogue which is not in nor has the slightest relation to this film id guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie ins to madonnas im breathless albumif you watch it at home by end titles youll think theres two hours out of my life id like to have back save yourself the wasted time do not bother with this,negative
this movie is really good the plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle fighting scenes are very good theres a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but its only my opinion to watch and its fascinating show the only thing which may be irritating is actors look a bit too effeminate at least for me hong kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the s and s so five venoms or other its versions is great choice,positive
sometime ago i watched a video of paul thomas anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry couldve produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape paul thomas anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by burt reynolds his name is jack horner a director whose biggest dream is to make a real film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and at the same time exciting with the beauty and with the big cocks and tits soon as he meets eddie adams mark walhberg he believes that he has found the new star for his films and thats how the story of the young eddie in the porn industry beginsthe film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of eddies life and later we can see them outside the porn industry living their daily routine but soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party the story of the new eddie begins the story of dirk diggler all of them will taste the real success with dirk as the main star winning lots of prizes and helping jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about brock landers the new character of dirk this sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for jack are his firsts real films but here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the horrible s when there is going to be ex drugs and rock roll for dirk and pals but we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to societys bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses in dirks decadence after trying and failing in the music industry theres a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for dirk and his friends that sequence is the one of his first drug deal with the appearance of alfred molina which ends in a total mess is funny for us and a terrible experience for dirk and pals but theres always a solution if you get back in what you know and when dirk is back brock is backwell i havent mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but i must say that all are amazingly well developed the cast is just superb with the best performance that i have seen of mark walhberg julianne moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character reilly macy hoffman heather graham guzman etc are just memorable all of their characters with funny and sad momentsfinally i really love the amazing cinematic style of anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late s and early s i used to say that magnolia was my favourite of anderson but right now after watching all except sidney i cant say that i have a favourite because i love them allps somewhere i read that this film is the scorsese film of anderson so im more than sure that if you love goodfellas and casino you will love this one too i fcking love boogie nights,positive

gregory pecks brilliant portrayal of douglas macarthur from the battle of corregidor in the philippines at the start of the pacific war largely through to his removal as un commander during the korean war offers reason to believe all three of the above possibilities certainly the most controversial american general of the second world war and possibly ever macarthur is presented here as a man of massive contradictions he claims that soldiers above all yearn for peace yet he obviously glories in war he consistently denies any political ambitions yet almost everything he does is deliberately used to boost himself as a presidential candidate he obviously believes that soldiers under his command have to follow his orders to the letter yet he himself deliberately defies orders from the president of the united states he shows great respect for other cultures particularly in the philippines and japan and yet is completely out of touch with his own country all these things are held in balance throughout this movie and in the end the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the man although one is left with no doubt that macarthur sincerely and passionately loved his country and especially the army he devoted his life topecks performance was as i said brilliant to the point actually of overshadowing virtually everyone else in the film which is perhaps appropriate given who he was portraying with the possible exception of ed flanders i though he offered a compelling look at harry truman and his attitude to macarthur sarcastic repeatedly referring to macarthur as his majesty angry frustrated and finally completely fed up with this general who simply wont respect his authority as president marj dusay was also intriguing as macarhurs wife jean devoted to her husband whom she herself referred to as general although their relationship seems to have been a happy enough one i very much enjoyed this movie although perhaps would have liked to have learned a little more about macarthurs early life i have always chuckled at macarthurs reaction to eisenhower being elected president hell make a fine president he was the best damn clerk i ever had which seems to sum up what macarthur thought the role of the president should be especially to his military commanders during wartime well worth watching,positive
piece is cake is defeatist revisionist history of the worst kind whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the admittedly fictional pilots it portrays it left a remarkably bad taste in my mouthin the march aeroplane monthly roland beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that raf fighter command was portrayed in the tv mini series a few of his comments are worth repeatingthere was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that i saw in action and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in piece of cake it would not have been tolerated for a moment the prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club though with more discipline nor was there any sense of death or glory raf training had insisted that we were there to defend this country and now we were required to do it no more and no lessthere was no discussion of bravery or cowardice people either had guts or they did not but mostly they did but we knew fear recognised it in ourselves and in each other did our damnedness to control it and then got on with the jobi could feel no glory but there was a sense of greatness and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to piece of cakebeamont was in his own words a fighter pilot who unlike the author and producer of the recent tv series was there at the timebeamont served with squadron both in france and the bob before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the typhoon and tempest and a post war test pilotpiece of cake is an absolute total misrepresentation of the way pilots in fighter command acted at the time it is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace,negative

sir john gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this onethis is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but dont be fooledits garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like thisin this masterpiece giegud recites shakespeares the tempest while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool wow this is heady stuff and real art aint it thats just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didnt understand so they give it high marks to save their phony egos you want shakespeare read his books,negative
new rule nobody is allowed to make any more zombie movies unless they actually come up with an original ideasadly this movie doesnt they have the premise that bounty hunters go out and kill zombies and prove it by cutting off their fingers well problems with that most people have ten fingers why not just collect ten bounties for one zombie why not just kill a regular person and pass that off as a zombie finger not to mention the utter silliness of hunting zombies with a bolt action riflei sometimes think films like this are resume fillers for makeup and fx guys hey this is what i did with ten dollars and some recylced bottles deposit imagine what i could do if you gave me a budget do you think anyone goes to drama school or cinema school to star in a zombie movie i went to the school of the arts check me out as the tunnel zombie in quick and the undead his mother must be so proudthese had to be the wimpiest zombies ever as a whole crowed of them apparently couldnt push down a wooden door or even break a glass window no they had to wait for the bounty hunter to open the door for them,negative
this movie was working toward two goals to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story its often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story consider the highly political but rarely entertaining final season of ellen beyond rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytellingi already knew that aung san suu kyi had won the nobel peace prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in burma so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what i already knew but i thought the movie did a good job of telling about aung san suu kyi and the mostly faceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her the device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common but its quite well done in this movieof course the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son she is convincingly detached and depressed her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand something shed otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble intoonce the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief shes trapped with no easy escape that sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive the writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place the directing is strong also keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorshipthis movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period we were preparing for a trip to india and heard news reports of western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in india avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship but the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country that common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling the movie illustrates the international tourists worst nightmare,positive
this and immoral tales both left a bad taste in my mouth it seems to me that borowczyk is disgusted by sex and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex as a film its not very well done some of the acting is truly epically bad such as the american woman with the french accent the young womans sudden flip flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested when it seems like it should have been the other way around and the aunts sudden realization of the young mans secret dont make sense theyre not explained at all i also didnt like how the daughters relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her familys perversion or predilection for bestiality the central idea the idea that theres this sexy beast if you will that lives in the woods could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty sex negative morality play,negative
michelle pfeiffer and matthew modine are a joy to watch in this screwball comedy alec baldwin who was an up and coming star when the film was made is a hoot dean stockwell in a sendup of john gotti is hysterical but mercedes ruehl as the paranoid and over the top connie steals the moviejonathan demme previously known for wacky comedies like something wild and melvin and howard proves once again that he is a genius i was not surprised at all when he went on to win the oscar for directing silence of the lambs the performances he evokes from his actors in married are inspired and the audience is taken along for a wild and wooly rideone of the cutest most endearing films of the s it stands head and shoulders above many of the satires of its era,positive
it was a good story but not very well told i liked the themes and the main story line which wasnt as clear as it could have been maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in the acting was okay to cheesy some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didnt keep my attention and the flow was just bad i only just finished watching it and im glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end again a good story but the delivery was sub par would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy and i do mean a little,negative
for the uninitiated almost any andy milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that ive seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddinessthis is of course milligans take on the sweeney todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headache inducing camera work grainy quality as for the gore well the version i saw may have been cut some for theres not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title the best indication of subversive film making here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victims titso while i will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf its definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though recommended for only the foolhardy morbidly curious out of,negative
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense based on the book evil angels and titled so in its australian release a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch it presents a scenario thats all too real for us in america the witch hunt against a person deemed an easy targetlindy chamberlain was this woman being someone who spoke her mind someone who didnt play the sympathy card and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she didnt kill her own child the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece and through it all lindy remained as stoic as ever even when her husband michael was falling apartthis stance of course is the power of strength as unsympathetic as it may look like and people happen to react strongly to that they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn not sit there and look blank people dont understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold but not unfeeling woman one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty because of her sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair someone has to or the chamberlains would be too detached and no one wants to see that except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news media theyll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public,positive
twelve monkeyss got all the elements to become terry gilliams masterpiece an outstanding screenplay a sustained rhythm clever sometimes ironic dialogs moreover he had a good nose about the cast twelve monkeys is also the first movie where bruce willis stands back from the kind of character he used to play in his previous movies here a jaded and hopeless character which you could nickname a prisoner took over from a fearless and invincible hero as it was the case in die hard no matter how he tries hes a prisoner of the time the movie contains a very thrilling end too its got a real dramatic power but this terrific movie is also a reflection about man the dangers he dreads notably the ones that could cause the end of the world and here these are virus that can create illnesses no matter how long it will take twelve monkeys will be estimated at its true value one of the masterpieces made in the nineties,positive
aside from the horrendous acting and the ridiculous and ludicrous plot this movie wasnt too bad unfortunately that doesnt leave much movie not to suck do not waste your time on this film even if you find yourself suffering from insomnia as i did watch an infomercial instead,negative
i think i win the bargain contest for this movie since i got it as part of a martial arts movie classics dvd collection with movies for bucks which means i paid something like cents for the chance to watch the black fist version of a movie that was released as bogard for a basic revenge flick black fist isnt too bad even though it is obviously hampered by a low budget one of my informal rules of thumb for watching a movie is that if the lead actor is better than his production and screenplay the movie automatically gets at least three stars that is certainly the case here lawson has some presence and some charisma and probably deserved a better film career than he got the street fight choreography the ostensible reason for the film really wont to impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been punched in a schoolyard fight i only spent about two years learning basic kung fu but even i would never fall for the front stamp kicks arm drags and roundhouse punches on display here but the atmosphere is good dust and blood and shouting crowds and the actors put some feeling into the fight scenes less believable is the plot dawsons character leroy fisk is portrayed as a street smart sharp young man who goes looking for work as a pick up fighter in illegal unsanctioned street matches yet he is surprised and indignant when he has to pay off the cops excuse me but i was raised in small town iowa and even i knew from watching hard times with charles bronson that the cops have to be paid off for this sort of action and that the guys who fight needed the fixers in order to get their matches and that the fixers were worth the money so you have to watch this movie with a sort of willful suspension of your critical faculties in order to accept it as a black brother being repressed movie most of the other non black fighters in the stable get punched in the face for the same deal tooyesthe movie suffers from a short attention span the director obviously didnt have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed so he had to fill in the gaps with some fairly ludicrous exposition scenes the i wined him i dined him and then i killed him scene just doesnt work along with voice overs and montages that are clumsy and unconvincing this is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought this is a little shoddy when you consider that the death of fisks wifes death is supposed to fuel his drive for revengebut once the movie switches all the way from young fighter rising through the ranks to the revenge theme it picks up a little steam and plays with a little more conviction im not sure that the final payoff is worth the buildup roger ebert calls this sort of thing a long drive for a short day at the beachbut it does tie things off in a reasonably satisfying way if sylvester stallone had made this film with a real budget and the same cast slicker sets and costumes and himself as the hero people would have hailed it as the next rocky which goes to show you how circumstance and chance can play havoc with would be filmmakers dreams worth seeing once for various decent shots and lines and to watch dabney coleman embarrass himself in a role that is beneath him,negative
ive seen the original english version on video disneys choice of voice actors looks very promising i cant believe im saying that the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film the animation quality is excellent if youve seen disneys job of kikis delivery service you can see the quality in their production it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion but not quite finally miyazakis films are being released properly i cant wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa,positive
this movie does have some great noirish neorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of hollywoods sugar coating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film but some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and i found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screenthe dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on most of the characters were either italian americans or italian immigrants living in new york in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks toward the end i was laughing and not because the filmmakers wanted me to i guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking italian and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk but it absolutely did not work for meanother line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason the main characters son born and raised in new york in the s suddenly picks up a lovely lilting british accent im only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in englandi give this movie an a for effort and intention but a considerably lower grade for execution,negative

sure this movie may have had its funny moments with the sat question people and i know the movie is not supposed to be totally believable the movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like that would never in a million years go out wit ha guy like that also people in movie had lackluster performances there acting was so bad also the plot bad they could have don e a better job on the scripting at least and focused more on the comedy the comedy was also a little dry and got really boring after the first few jokes it was like mins was laughter then the old when is this gonna end started to kick in the bottom line if u want a a lackluster of acting mixed in with a stupid plot and a romance go ahead and watch this movie,negative
i viewed the first two nights before coming to imdb looking for some actor info i saw the rating which surprised me since i was not that impressed by what id seen as reference i happen to believe lonesome dove was the best tv western ever i grew up next to the mgm back lots in culver city in the s and have a certain sense of reverence about the western genre so i saw the glowing first review and decided to read more there i found several reviews with or stars that summed up my feelings well about the lack of character development poor editing feeling that it was shot on the universal back lot mgms is long gone and overall impression that it was not going to come close to changing my feelings about ld my impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was less than a this got me to wondering about the process that yields a rating if the people giving the s and s do not take the time to justify their vote is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation i have long used imdb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available now i am not so sure,negative
as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate capshaw who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene shes in connery is fine as is fishbourne but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have thanksgiving dinner so to compensate they added an overloud dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it,negative

ive never laughed and giggled so much in my life the first half kept me in stitches the last half made me come completely unglued i think i giggled for minutes after the tape was overhis timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled and though he talks fast you catch every joke which is probably why my laugh center was so overwhelmed it took an extra minutes to laugh at everything,positive
i remember this movie quite intense for an year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard id watch it again if it were rebroadcast but the signal is passing pluto as i write this robert culp a highlight of his career i am just glad i didnt live in that neighborhood oh those s what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre pubescent suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in lodi nj the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the filmand then they left the carcass on the stoop rotten kids,positive
i signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is besides being a rip off of executive decision or air force one or any other kind of terrorist story this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well its hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid cliché ridden script to work with its bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence but when you find yourself groaning over and over again you have to conclude that the director also isnt the brightest bulb in the movie business nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place the mostly low rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure not that being a part of this joke of a movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition it may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser i see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case for to do so would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand just as studying well made movies can inspire you how to make a good skillfully put together work of art and beauty the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what not to do and what does not work be warned,negative
i saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from nyc after minutes i said to him youve got to be kidding is this some sort of joke he thought it was good i told him that i thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made what was it supposed to be i asked a propaganda movie made for children the plot is stupid the acting is the worst ever for most of the principals and frankly people who look at this sort of tripe and think it has anything to do with life love or even afterlife of which it offers an incredibly idiotic viewneed some psychiatric help please if someone tries to get you to stick this in your dvd or video player consider it like you would a virus introduced into your computerit wont destroy your player but it will destroy your evening if they had made razzies in the s this would have won in every category ps it also goes under the dubious sobriquet of stairway to heaven,negative
you know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of jeopardythe saddest thing about white men cant jump is that it had tremendous potential for several years i lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone a film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in white men cant job left something to be desiredthe movies sequence of events is cyclical first billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball he then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax i saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketballin order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well apparently the writers of white men cant jump forgot this rule as the plot can be summarized as billy needs to pay the bills i appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but im sorry this was just plain awful i could have cared less if billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartmentdespite all this white men cant jump is a successful film apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them others im sure were lured by the big names playing the leading roles this leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse would anyone have bothered watching this movie i really dont think soill give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the jeopardy scene which kept me awake for a few minutes thanks trebek,negative
zodiac killer was an interesting film from german born director ulli lommel he directs produced and co stars in this latest production not only does he manage to make an interesting film on the cheap but he reaches a new low when herr lommel works in footage from nearly his entire film catalog i have seen film clips from boogeyman i and ii war birds tenderness of the wolf brain waves and cocaine cowboys even andy warhol makes a cameo from beyond the grave courtesy of this film even though he uses plenty of old footage he works them in well and very creatively might i addthe film follows a young man who copies the original zodiac killer he also corresponds with a writer ulli lommel who originally wrote about the serial killer during the late sixties and early seventies the writers friend david hess helps him to try and find this wannabe zodiac can this killer be stopped will the writer put two and two together and reclaim some of his old glory is david hess still the man youll have to find out for yourself and watch the zodiac killerthis film is not about the original zodiac killer i have also heard people whine about this film being shot on video so what the directors old school artistic style outshines the fact that its shot on video my only complaint was the over use of stock footage from herr lommels earlier films but i understand why wink wink dont believe the hype this is a gritty and street level horror film like the disclaimer in the beginning states this film does nor glorify murder you got to like that statementhighly recommend for ulli lommel fans,positive
i dont know about you but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the often violent interaction between the two characters mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york and as far as i am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of catas magical as jerrys exploration of the big apple might be for the other tj fans who have commented here on imdb i couldnt wait for this self indulgent rubbish to end so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvdin fact the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost buys the farm hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road,negative
well i have to admit that this movie brought some occasional laughs to my face ok but that does not make it a good movie most of the characters are terrible stereotypes and truly unconvincing not all of them give great acting performances but some really try but fail because their characters are badly written the perfect example is julia koschitz she changes her eating habits from one talk to the other on one talk she does not drink alcohol on the next she is allergic to champagne she feels too beautiful for most people in fact she is but still ends up with the perfect fit concerning the looks and refuses to give some more realistic guys a chance and so on the end is very cheesy although i like one of the final scenes when everybody finally stops talking and the director gives us a chance to catch our breath again shoppen is basically a movie that offers some cheap laughters mostly because it is about sex and relationships i assume and maybe some short entertainment still the whole picture is one big stereotype and nothing is really special about it,negative
i managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of mstk and oh boy even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkeythe highlights what little there were came from the special effects which were ok the acting for the most part was also ok though nothing special it was of a higher quality than other b movies i have seen in the pastthe rest of this movie is dismally bad the camera work often looks like theyve just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along the story if it can be called that is so full of holes its almost funny it never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place or needs human flesh in order to survive the script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid the climax to movie if there is one is absolutely laughableif you cant find the mstk version avoid this at all costs,negative
ill be honest with yall i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didnt think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy this was a great show to watch and ill tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my brothers and sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadnt passed away,positive
i saw this film as a kid about years ago and i havent forgotten it to this day i couldnt say whether its a good picture but in those days i instantly fell in love with jean simmons the memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but i still remember the plot simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling david leans great expectations and again it was the young jean simmons its a pity that blue lagoon is not available on video id like to correct my memories,positive
dragon fighter is the first sci fi channel although i guess its now called syfy original movie i have ever seen but i have seen one or two others since and i can tell you that they were stupid but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrel the cgi is done poorly the acting is bad the script is ridiculous and what happens at the very end is unexpected and out of place if you have seen dragon fighter you probably know what i mean i didnt want to put a spoiler in my review plus there was this one musical tune that was used in pretty much every single dangerous sequence that was really stupid they just played it over and over and its definitely not original i know ive heard that somewhere before i just cant remember where this is one to avoid,negative
what can one say about any wilder film other than they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them bugs themhaunts them billy created pictures like paintings that stand forever reflecting the human condition he paints the good and the bad in all of us he also paints with love i cant imagine anyone having a list of greatest films without a wilder film on it they will last because they are true i first saw this movie on tv in the s when i was a kid and i had to leave the room because i felt tears welling up in me and was embarrassed now im an old man and i still feel the tears welling but dont leave the room i knew these people and loved them and grew up around them billy preserved them in this film and not in a greatest generation way but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit,positive

once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists work has been fully restored and we see this old time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etcin essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettesthe whole show is narrated by jack bunny a jack benny impersonator with music from conductor leopold stokowski who was in so many looney tunes animated shorts i have lost count a lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who little egypt and other characters the busby berkeley type aqua number with bathing suited sardines coming out of the can and the tomato can can dance were both clever all of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer than normal length cartoon the second half was about a king kong type which escapes from the animal crackers box and terrorizes everyone that part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note so an a for the first half a d for the second making it about a c plus or b minus overall,positive
this is the slowest film noir film ive ever seen very weak script only provides opportunity for jack palance and rod steiger to deliver exceptionally well lines that were made for an acting audition palance and steiger both affirm they are indeed serious actors who can portray their respective roles with power emotion and drama the story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace mostly taking place in a living room the director obviously moved the actors around in a rythmatic circles as they delivered exhaustingly long lines to keep the slow pace from becoming noticeable to the audience the action doesnt pick up until the last ten minutes of the film if youre one whos looking for more depth in a crime drama this ones not for you,negative
wow the naked brothers band what should i say i guess i can say this show just sucks number one they have no talent they probably cant even play the instruments number on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on look i really dont hate it that bad id give it like a out of but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics deep my ass he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings wow i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that and they didnt get famous by themselves their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon,negative

i saw this film at the sundance film festival and i too was surprised that it didnt generate more notice because it was not only powerful and beautifully crafted but very original the audience was totally engaged and the greatest part of seeing a film like this at a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and cast in the qa session afterward they literally had to throw us out of the screening room for the next film we could have gone on for a lot longer the film is thought provoking and hilarious at the same time it will be a shame if this film isnt picked up for wider distribution i hope it will at least become available on dvd because i want to see it again and share it with everyone i know,positive
thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented angela jones now deeply unfunny garbage its no wonder reb braddock hasnt directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of quentin tarantino himself and creates something like this anyone who feels that this was a story worth telling to the world doesnt deserve a second break under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what theyre told to do and they do it well its just that they shouldnt have done it in the first place out of,negative
always fancied this film from the video cover eventually got round to buying it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film a simply stunning performance from all of the case and its filmed so beautifully even at times from a distance so you can barely hear what the dialogue is as if you really are that distance away picking up bits of the tale its really moving frequently amusing and very watchable not much dialogue but is filmed in such a way that you feel so much throuout a from me a must see,positive
director alfred greens melodrama baby face with barbara stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the pre code movies these films were produced before the production code administration had the power to enforce its rules in inspiration scenarist gene markey and midnight mary scribe kathryn scola penned the screenplay based on mark canfields story about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society incidentally mark canfield was a pseudonym for producer daryl f zanuck these pre code films today seem tame but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late s when the code began to erode the themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men women versus women and women versus society our crafty protagonist does enough skulduggery that all themes are about equallilys worthless father nick powers robert barret of distant drums operates an illegal speakeasy bar during prohibition when the thirteen amendment outlawed liquor and brews his own booze in a still out back nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he pimps out her beautiful but hard working daughter lily barbara stanwyck of night nurse but lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician the politician ed sipple arthur hohl of private detective vows to retaliate for lilys refusal to accommodate him later nick chews his rebellious daughter out lily reproaches him yeah im a tramp and whos to blame my father a swell start you gave me nothing but men dirty rotten men and youre lower than any of them no sooner has she stormed off than nick dies when his still blows up and kills him lily and her african american maid chico theresa harris of arrowsmith pack their bags and catch a ride of the first freight leaving townno sooner have our heroines arrived in new york than lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank visually director green shows lilys shrewd ascension up the ladder with camera angles that move upward until lilys sexuality threatens to destroy the bank at one point lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer ned stevens donald cook of the public enemy and his fiancée anne carter margaret lindsay of cavalcade after stevens had almost fired her for flirting with her boss brody douglas dumbrille of his women in the employee restroom lily is extremely shrewd and manages to emerge from each debacle better off than before the board of trustees hires courtland trenholm george bent of jezebel to take over as president of the bank the first thing that trenholm does is pay off lily instead of letting her publish her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank moreover trenholm ships lily off to their branch bank in paris where lily doesnt create any commotion until trenholm arrives and they become romantically attached lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husbandironically lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in but trenholm and she are happy now baby face qualifies as one of the five best pre code movies look for john wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene,positive
this film had so much promise i was very excited about this film in the end it was laughable at best painful at worst the acting styles ran the gamut from really really flat the angels the wife and daughter to over animated caspers character i felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other pay special attention to the scene regarding the bug its pretty much an insult to the audiences ability to figure things out in defense of that scene though it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie i had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations too bad they didnt make use of it i didnt feel like i was transported to exotic locations anybody could insert stock footage of the coliseum in rome however to end on a positive note i thought the sets were pretty good i really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers it is my opinionand thats all it is that if the schmaltz factor would have been much much lower and the action factor would have been greatly increased this film would have been good,negative
so boring youll fall asleep after the first minutes sorry mr boutonnat i do admire your work all these beautiful films you directed such as tristana sans logique etc but here the plot is extremely vain except the magnificent photography everything appears dumb and theres no envy to know what will happen at these medium actors moreover the dialogs are minimalists the famous question where are the children is repeated so often it looks like a farce believe me its a pure waste of time concerning the plot and hours is a long long time certainly the real reason of this box office total mess,negative

as a horror movie fan i try to watch all significant novelties of this genre especially those which are the products of my native cinema and i can say that that the power of fear or vedma as the russian title of it is one of the weakest film among them firstly it cant scary even a little kid it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror frankly speaking its bad in all points from the goofy plot i dont know why the russian producers director decided to transform the classic story about ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern day america thriller i absolutely agree with the previous reviewer it doesnt thrill a bit and to the terrible and cheesy actors work all actors including the leading valeri nikolayev and yevgeniya kryukova who are quite famous in russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didnt even bother to play at all only spoke their english lines without any expression and at the end i dont really understand why they filmed this flick in english with russian actors i think it was their wrong turn at least they could cast some american or english actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing the same i can say about so called small american town backgrounds which were shot in estonia and look like it the only positive moment i found in the power of fear is the visual effects they are not excellent but rather good for the russian film and the music is ok at least it doesnt irritate me thats why i give it two stars overall if you want to see good horror film dont waste your time and money on this boring flick and if you are looking for something that claims to be a russian horror id advise you to find a copy of viy or the spirit of evil its really the terrific movie based on the same novel as power of fear but much much better,negative

firstly i would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors anything that has a rating below is clearly utter nonsensecreep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects the actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing there is much mystique in this film many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels how was craig created and what happened to hima fantastic film with a large chill factor a film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like days later the bunker dog soldiers and deathwatchlook forward to more of these fantastic films,positive
combine good casting bad writing good orchestral scoring bad dialogue and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have slipstream just bought the movie for a buck it is worth it but not much more good to see mark hamill act again there should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place bersteins score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits however the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score it is really easy to dog a movie like this after all it is by the producer of starwars and the director of tron and a tremendous cast but it is what it is and that aint muchfavorite line were going to make it ha haboom,negative

this is probably the best television show ive ever seen i first saw it on comedy central several years ago at the time i was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order and having just watched all three series in order and unedited thank you internet and your wondrous series of tubes i am so glad i rediscovered it i think comedy central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a seasonand i tried to get friends and family to watch it but nobody really seemed to like it i need new friends so on my own i made the best out of it that i could even when i felt like it was waning a bit i still felt compelled to continue watching years after when i discovered little britain i immediately recognized pauline from log as having influenced marjorie in fat fighters also i love the idea of writers who act the entire shownot new but done impeccably here lb has nothing on log no offense matt davidlove you this is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius serial murder implied cannibalismyou name it and its probably found in this wonderful unique piece of tv art the location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of royston vaseyyoull never leave i think my favorite character would have to be tubbs but each character as portrayed has its own charm my least favorite was papa lazarous that was until he re surfaced in series three clever and wholly unexpected its best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as i said before becomes so compelling while repulsing that you really cant stop watching this is not for those with weak stomachs kids conservatives or grandma unless youve got one saucy granny i have always loved british tv particularly comedies from monty python to benny hill red dwarf to keeping up appearances absolutely fabulous and the british originals coupling and the office but not their us counterpartssorry this is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between whats funny and whats just sick and twisted nothing nothing on us tv has ever come close to this level of entertainment us broadcast tv is so sad and lame i can barely stand to watch any of it its kind of sad that even our cable channels dont have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem your loss comedy central thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the across the pond that redeem the entire medium every decade or so basic cable here in the us has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently crossing lines with more graphic sexual content drug use and adult language but they are still years away from just deciding to be adults about showing real life adult behavior instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up sheesh its like the same basic show format for the past years dont even get me started on us sitcoms waste of time and lots of wasted moneydid you know that according to jim has been on the air for years years anyway watch this show get it on dvd do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well youve never seen anything like it there are three specials that i have not watched yetim saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits hell watch them even if i have to chain him up and paint him with excrement lines and lines and lines and lines note that series three departs from one and twothe greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters the laugh track is gone thank bloody hell the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of royston vasey dont be thrown by any of that as by the end the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two i think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable brilliant confident and absolutely demented you will want to re watch it again and again its amazing that in seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close up facial expression if ever i were to meet any of the writer performers id implore them not to recreate it or try to top itid just say can i help you at all then theyd probably slap me so id ask them to sign the slap mark out of,positive

i concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced even hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work careers should instead have ended over this inconsequential driveloth there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad and chad lowe is terrifically and consistently bad,negative

after the turning point of night must fall robert montgomery for the most time came into his finest films and performances here comes mr jordan they were expendable the lady in the lake ride the pink horse the saxon charm june bride even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable rage in heaven mr and mrs smith but montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work in he made what would be his last movie performance he played collier lang an egotistical movie star who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girls boyfriendapparently my view of this film is a minority view most of the views given are favorable about it i thought it was a dull witless script with ann blyths groupie heroine not very appealing as a character she admires montgomery as a star and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities but after awhile i found there was no chemistry between them the script was also devoid of much fun although montgomery and roland winters did try the only thing i recall to this day as a joke point was that taylor holmes is the wealthy father of blyth and he is an admirer of winston churchill so he always dresses up as churchill and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat smoking a large cigar and painting holmes bald head helps in the disguise that was the most memorable joke from this film not much of a real memorymontgomery went into early television and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures his last contact with the movies was his direction of the gallant hours about admiral william bull halsey starring his friend jimmy cagney it is a far better film than this for his overall film and television career i will give this mediocre film a that strikes me as generous,negative
deceptive advertising i saw a commercial for carlitos way rise to power that states from the producer of scarface and carlitos way lets get it straight michael bergman did not produce scarface in fact he was editing room assistant for scarface not to take away from bergmans talent but in my opinion he should of had a little more class i think i can speak for the masses when i say we hate being blatantly lied to as far as the movie goes it was poor at best i did think puff daddy did a good job although luis guzman should be ashamed for working on this film overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for carlitos way its obvious this project was an attempt to make a quick buck rather a good film,negative
no spoilersi love horror movies but this has got to be the poorest attempt to make one ever calling it a movie is also a stretch this random clips of obviously fake and tacky violence and an ugly woman trying to act sexy edited poorly together is not worth watchingwatching this is about as interesting watching as some random familys holiday pictures and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new vid cam and tell him to make a movieterrible,negative

du rififi chez les hommes rififi can on the surface be described as a french variation on john hustons seminal heist film asphalt jungle the difference between the two films is rififi pays a little more attention in detail to the robbery sequence also the police arent involved in the aftermath of the robbery in rififi as much as in asphalt jungle in the end rififi is in my opinion a slightly better film than asphalt jungle remarkable noir picture that defines s french cinemaspartacus may have been the one which broke down the infamous blacklist but in my opinion rififi was the film that began to break apart the unbreakable hollywood blacklist first film in five years for jules dassin who was victimized by the mccarthy communist hunt of the late s to early s he got some sort of retribution when rififi became a success around france and europe thus defying the poisonious hollywood blacklist in a major way that probably inspired others to do the same rififi is the most important film of dassins career because it not only restored his name but also gave him a second chance at making filmsjules dassin gave the filmworld and its ever growing audiences a masterpiece of influential proportions his handling of the material is exceptional and direction of the actors is flawless builds up tense situations with precise craftsmanship dassin came full circle in the film noir genre by directing his best and last noir rififi marked the end of dassins period in filmmaking when he was involved in doing noir picturesrififi is the number one film in an arsenal of thirty plus films for director jules dassin a masterpiece in acting cinematography directing editing and writing not a film to leave your seat for one minute because there is always something memorable going on as brilliant as anything by jean pierre melville who was a master of this type of film masterpieces such as rififi are relatively small compared to the probably billions of films made in motion picture historythe one fascinating aspect of rififi is the precise planning and careful execution of a robbery that takes up a bulk of the minute duration the main characters plan and execute the jewel heist in the same way a film director prepares for the pre productions production and post production of a film shows how difficult a jewel heist like in rififi is in committing and why very few would do something like it the fact that the scene hardly contains a mess up like in other heist films turns this scene into something even greater close as one can get to having a perfect sequence in a motion picturelack of unnatural sound in the landmark thrity minute heist sequence puts it in a realm of absolute realism any dialogue or and music would ruin any suspense and tension the director is trying to create the use of natural sound makes the heist sequence a rewarding film viewing experience now filmmakers and producers would use dialogue and music in a scene like this because of a lack of confidence of a mainstream filmgoers patience sustains a level of consistency that never once lets downmaintaining a high level of suspense is what makes the heist sequence tick to perfection the director achieves suspense in the heist sequence thats rarely equaled in most robbery scenes from heist films jean servais and the rest of the main actors contribute to the suspense with some low key acting getting suspense put in a scene is a task few are capable of doing the robbery sequence of rififi reaches a hitchcockian level of suspense and tensionmany filmmakers from the years following du rififi chez les hommes have been influenced if not inspired by it one filmmaker influenced was jean pierre melvilleoriginal choice for director of rififiwho used variations of the heist sequence in le doulos and le cercle rouge another filmmaker influenced was stanley kubrick who made a similarly themed film in the killing also quentin tarantino whose debut feature reservoir dogs was inspired by this film other film directors influenced are john woo michael mann paul schrader ringo lam etcdu rififi chez les hommes is comparable to bob le flambeur in many ways one jules dassin and jean pierre melville directed groundbreaking films in rififi and bob le flambeur two each film involves an aging criminal who plans and carries out a daring heist three bob le flambeur and rififi finishes in fatalistic fashion four each film shares many motifs and situations that classify the two as film greatspart of rififis charm are the colorful characters that surround the story such as tony le stephanois jo le suedois mario farrati and cesar le milanais most of the violence is implicit yet effectively brutal the main characters led by tony le stephanois abide by a strong outdated code of honor that is remindful of sam peckinpah and john woo jean servais becomes the role of tony le stephanois with his cynical outlook and tired looks du rififi chez les hommes rififi became a favorite of mine the moment i saw it on the big screen from beginning to end,positive
i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic happenstance occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right this show is a total crud pie belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn the women are physically attractive but too stepford is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell except except for the wonderful comic sty lings of larry joe campbell americas greatest comic character actor this guy plays belushis brother in law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good thats like trying to make butt warts look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should invent a nobel prize in comic buffoonery so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking courtney thorne smith smacking belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage stars for larry joe campbell designated comedic bacon because he improves the flavor of everything hes in,negative

its hard to imagine a director capable of such godawful crap as notting hill pulling off something as sensitive and as attractive as this but well heres the evidence and its quite compelling several have alluded to tv drama and yes this does have a seventies play for today feel at times but is always a cut above mainly i think owing to some quite superlative acting from anne reid and to a fine script which shadow boxes with cliché without ever getting one on the nose except maybe right at the end i didnt like either the tracking shot of indifferent goodbyes through the hallway nor the oh what a beautiful morning final scene she deserved a more studied finale than that i think after all that hard work the slippers business was a bit ott too on reflectionwhat i mean about avoiding cliché well i for one had a sinking expectation that the mature man mays daughter tries to set her up with would be cast in dimensions as a repulsive old bore so as to point the contrast more painfully with the attractive virile young geezer he is unwittingly competing with instead we get an unexpectedly subtle and sympathetic cameo of a lonely clumsy not entirely unlikeable and very human fellow who nevertheless doesnt have much of a clue about entertaining a woman it was around that point i started to sit up and pay more attention here was a script that let the actors breathe and do something interesting with fairly minor parts almost mike leigh in that respect minus the contrived catharses that the latter inexplicably goes in forand of course i was as everyone probably was dumbfounded by what anne reid does with her character and with her body shes not the repressed dutiful housewife discovering herself for the first time this is far too simplistic for the character we have again and again there are allusions to her having been a bad housewife not to mention that thing she does with trays trying to look nurturing and comely and only succeeding in looking awkward the daughter accuses her of having sat in front of the tv all day instead of well whatever her motherly duties might be presumed to have been she has no answer she never was a model wife and mother at least not to herself thats where a lot of the poignancy comes from the sense of someone having wasted a life trying to fulfil a role she simply wasnt good at ever,positive
minutes of this is crueland i love the old munsters yes the plot is thing yes the lines are trite but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan there is so much intrigue and i use that word with great pause that i wonder if its an old starsky hutch episode i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid s ludicrous the producers simply replace marilyn eddie with younger actors why not let them grow and age the addition of an addams family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween partygrandpa herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours preposterous sid ceaser is the most yes the most unbelievable character i am including the bad robots since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler and yes it looks like the laugh track is missing in fact there are several spots where there is dead air as if the laugh track was to be inserted later the actors seem to wait on the faux audience its not laughable its sad oh and the best part yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were marilyn says something like where could uncle herman and grandpa be they could have been in an accident they could have been hit by a caror a train lily says responds with something like youre uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track whats amazing about this is yvonne decarlos husband was a stuntman in the early s and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt he never recovered and this financially devastated her family check out biographys fantastic review of her life and career this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to herif you are a real fan of the munsters then youll have to rent this mess it illustrates how some things are better left alone even with the nearly original cast this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago,negative
i have searched for this movie for years i have great memories of the first rate acting and singing in this movie i never knew that the reason the movie was unobtainable was because of the actions of the gershwin family shame on them for trying to suppress at american classic i can only hope they will relent and allow this movie to be release and enjoyed by the american publicsammy davis jr is at his absolute best in this film the only other performance of his this is its equal was in anna lucasta another terrific film that i wish would be released on dvdporgy bess contained a first rate all star cast hopefully one day youll get to see for yourself,positive

georgia rule has got to be one of if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp what out loud at least times throughout its grueling two hour courseadvertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women jane fonda as the matriarch felicity huffman as her daughter and lindsay lohan as the rebellious over sexed scantily clad grand daughter the viewer thinks this will be a cliché light chick flick about growing up and coming together as a familytalk about false advertisement at it worstafter many shots of animals doing funny things in the background of pivotal scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctors office weekly to have her diaper changed or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohans character being sexually abused by her step father georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema the ungrounded horribly acted inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward surreal strange way if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama comedy then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums sideways junebug and so on and so onthe only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation say that the movie the year old virgin was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn belly laughs and comedy would ensue with all of the characters reactions being that of fake lifeless human beings pretending to care throw in a yellow parakeet dermot mulroney as the flattest most non dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy too tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other and youve got georgia rulei found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers screenwriters actors editors etcwho have a lot more talent and arent getting noticeddont see this movie my rule and if you must get sufficiently drunk before hand,negative
if one sits down to watch unhinged it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the uk for over years as virtually every video nasty does its true exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me the advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the uk dont necessarily make me want to watch it in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid british censors are how i came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only the price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next halloween but a cheap padding of your dvd collection never hurts i did force myself however to watch it all in one sitting because i find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it so anyway after minutes of unhinged i found that i had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence i think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing techniquethe layout of unhinged is of any common slasher from the s theres unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore thats about it anyway it starts with a group of three attractive co eds crashing their car on the way to a concert though two of them terry and nancy are okay one gloria is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie they are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion that happens to have no phone of course with rather strange occupants marion is a middle aged woman with a man hating mother who constantly accuses marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them echoes of psycho she also happens to have a crazy brother carl who lives in the woods because her mothers hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house after hanging with marion for awhile terry our hero and nancy decide they must contact their parents despite everyones warnings nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone her fate is not hard to predict after that we see gloria again who is then promptly butchered with an ax when terry discovers that gloria has disappeared from her room she decides something isnt right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends that may be easier said than done however with crazy carl lurking around after viewing unhinged i read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end normally i do not drag other peoples opinions into my reviews especially when they contradict my views but in this case i was so puzzled by their reactions that i thought it would be relevant to mention this is because in actuality the film crawls normally for the slow building tactic to work the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger oh sure we see two of them get murdered but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom we are aware that theres a killer on the loose but this is only focused on three times in the film that means theres no reason to fear for the victims instead the films events are explained not by the actions of the characters but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking if theres one thing i can assure you from watching this its that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for minutes are very tedious none of this is helped by the atrocious acting it seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experienceof course id be a liar if i said there wasnt one part of the movie that i enjoyed specifically the ending was one of the best ive ever seen in a slasher film you just do not expect that to happen just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular ah i wont spoil it for you nor will i say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow moving film but it definitely will get your attention other than that the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material but its not like you couldnt tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed however those are the only scenes of gore present that and of course no one scene can save an entire movie i normally preach the doctrine that as long as theres action the worse a movie is the better it gets unhinged only grasps one part of this concept the whole film just feels luke warm theres potential alright but the director either wasnt experienced enough to make it work or just didnt know what the hell he was doing,negative
over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids ive developed a sixth sense for spotting the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight i dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes and the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife prehysteria was head and shoulders above this arrgh,negative

cybertracker is set in los angeles sometime in the near future where bodyguard eric phillips co producer don the dragon wilson saves senator robert dilly john aprea from an assassination attempt by a group known as the uhr the union of human rights who are angry at dilly for spearheading the computerised judicial system in which robots called cybertrackers are sent out to determine dispense justice on the guilty anyway eric saves dilly who is very impressed decides to see if he can trust eric in his shady activities like the cold blooded murder of a traitor being the fine upstanding guy that he is eric isnt impressed when dilly kills a woman he is asked to keep it quiet eric escapes sets out to bring dilly down however dilly has lots of powerful friends he uses his influence to frame eric have his cybertrackers sent out in pursuit of himco produced directed by richard pepin i think films like cybertracker give films a bad name i didnt like it that much at all the script by jacobsen hart is pretty predictable it doesnt excite it steals most of its ideas theme from other better sci fi films the heady mix of martial arts action sci fi dont gel that well there a few fights some car chases a couple of shoot outs but its all rather bland forgettable the film lacks imagination considering the film is set in the future it deals with robots technology the way society is run its judicial system in particular speaking of which the fantastic robocop mixed its violent action clever social commentary brilliantly but cybertracker doesnt even try to make any relevant social statement or try to portray any meaningful moral message about law enforcement the script basically uses the concept to have robots shoot outs which robocop did as well but also managed to include a good story there is very little in cybertracker that i can say was entertaining thats what films are about rightdirector pepin does ok but nothing stands out its all rather forgettable its not particularly exciting the sci fi elements are nothing more than the robot side of things as a whole the film doesnt look that futuristic the action scenes are alright theres some exploding cars some shoot outs but nothing spectaculartechnically cybertracker is average for a film supposedly set in the future it already looks dated the special effects are poor the acting was bad i wonder if don the dragon wilson signs cheques with that namecybertracker was a waste of my time there is nothing here original or exciting the action is instantly forgettable poor thats all that needs to be said not recommended,negative
i hate to admit it but i didnt find it to be one of hitchcocks best but nonetheless a riveting climatic thriller in a remake of hitchocks movie of the same title dr ben mckenna james stewart the man who knows too much and his wife jo mckenna doris day are holidaying in morocco with their son hank christopher oslen when there is a case of mistaken identity and caught up in the web of an assassination plot the conspirators go to extreme lengths to prevent them from interfering with their plot kidnapping their beloved hanki found it surprising that doris day who i usually associate with rock hudson comedies was cast in a hitchcock film as i was watching it i soon realized that this was more of a family film compared to hitchcocks other works example psycho and she had singing ability needed to pull off que sera sera which she did beautifully she was well cast as herself and james stewart had chemistry which helped make the couple believablein comparison to the great directors other works i believe this isnt as good but it is still a exceedingly entertaining family thriller mystery there is also the added bonus of que sera sera which turned out to be a smash hit for doris day well directed well acted a fine film,positive

saw this at the hawaii film festival where the director and his wife who produced it took a qa afterwardsi found it hard to believe this is a first time director and all kudos to harvey keitel for once again taking a risk and going out on a limb for a script he likedcertainly reminiscent of cinema paradiso it tells the story of the young director on the turning of the revolution in cuba however dont expect this to be a movie about the revolution its political stance is wonderfully ambiguous many references to the directors obvious love of film history a great bicycle thief homage and some whimsical scenes which work with out being pretentiousenjoy,positive

this film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending but dont be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly only a little unexpectedly though nothing worth watching the thing through forfrom the taciturn and wronged hero to the germanic baddy to the expendable team the characters were entirely wooden and obvious the two fbi agents smith and wesson geddit gave some hope of humour but that came to nothingi am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film a turkey,negative
this film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not take some time relax enjoy think people who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it isnt hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted at first i was apprehensive of brosnan playing a native american given the story line though i think it was apt casting now back to my hermiting jahfre,positive

spoilers every major regime uses the countrys media to its own ends whether the nazi banning of certain leaflets or the televised chinese alternative of tianamen square governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time in though celebrating the failed mutiny of the russian communist government supported the creation of this film battleship potempkin a major piece of cinematic history it remains powerful and beautiful to this very dayset aboard the battleship potempkin the crew are unhappy in miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food they are angry at their upper class suppressors now though after the rotten food enough is enough led by grigory vakulinchuk aleksandr antonov the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedomas far as propaganda goes battleship potempkin is perfect presenting a positive light on the first unsuccessful communist mutiny the film was a useful soviet tool eighty years after the films release though and the ussr has disappeared completely off the map the amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country its message was intended for has disappeared the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinemawritten and directed by sergei eisenstein the film is surprisingly a joy to watch it is true that it is far from what we would nowadays consider entertainment but the film is a beautiful piece of artwhether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of odessa everything about this film is perfectly made the music is powerful and dramatic the lighting is flawless even the acting whilst slightly overdone is perfect for the piece basically there is no way to fault this films end productits impossible to know how the russian people received this film upon its release praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years its difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires as a piece of art though it is magnificent beautiful from start to finish it is far from an easy watch but it is well worth the effort,positive
this is the most disturbing film i have ever seen it makes requiem for a dream look like a disney film although technically it is reasonably well made acting cinematography music directing etc are good however the concluding gang rape scene is the most appalling and violent thing i have ever seen and i really wish i had not seen it i am afraid that it will haunt me for the rest of my life although i think anyone would find the film extremely disturbing my wife and some of her friends were victimized in a very similar manner and i really didnt need an explicit reminder of the horror that they experienced i saw the film at the sxsw film festival in austin tx and none of the cast or crew were in attendance i would have liked for them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film which i felt was excessive gratuitous and unnecessary an earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they were apparently striving for but without rubbing your face in the extreme and explicit sexual violence this film should have a big warning label on it for these reasons i would not recommend anyone seeing it youve been warned,negative
if youve been looking for a film where a out of control nympho gets chained to a radiator by an extremely religious southern man then look no further than paramount vantages latest release black snake moan not exactly looking for what i just described you say well then you best get ya wits bout yaself and mosey on down to your local theater and still see it as samuel l jacksons character lazarus would say as long as youre open minded and dont take everything seriously theres no reason you wont leave the theater glad you saw itin the third offering from director craig brewer we are taken into the deep south where as the tagline to the film claims everything is hotter while there were introduced to the godfearing bluesman lazarus as previously said played by jackson and the almost always half naked rae a role bravely taken on by christina ricci in the film this unlikely pair cross paths long enough for their characters to each learn a lesson from one another both lessons ultimately convey the message to us the audience that no matter what we are all human no one is perfect and if everyone would realize that then wed be a lot better off the question of if this will be understood or be accepted by all who see the film is another storyone thing not up for debate is how great jackson and ricci both are here youd think with the role of a sex crazed woman overacting would be a given but no not here ricci breaks through and demonstrates true talent with a raw performance that also doubles as her best to date then we have jackson who completely disappears and for the first time in a long time makes us forget who he even is sadly the third star of the film justin timberlake who plays raes military bound boyfriend isnt all that great at the start he fails miserably as he appears to be trying too hard later on he steps it up some still hes far from the level he reached in januarys alpha dogthe other thing black snake moan boasts is a splendid soundtrack containing tracks from the black keys john doe pieces from the score done by scott bomar of course four count em four tracks from jackson himself its actually one of his songs the main performance of the film stackolee that is the fuel to the fire of this great collection it alone is worth the ticket price other notable musical delights from the soundtrack are bomars the chain when the lights go out from the black keys the title track which is also among the most memorable scenes in the film where lazarus sings to rae on a stormy nightthe efforts of craig brewer cant go without mention though his last film hustle flow which ended up surpassing low expectations and gaining critical acclaim put him on the map what he has done with black snake moan will be what sets him apart from other newbies to the industry he not only directed moan but also wrote its screenplay the end result is a story that is surprising and clever as you watch you feel like you know exactly where its headed despite its valiant composure just as you think youve predicted the next move brewer shifts gears and takes an entirely different route there are however some blotches within the screenplay the background characters are drab and flat while the ending is somewhat disappointing it left me craving for something more exciting after so many highs i guess the final scenes were a tad weak compared to the rest of the filmi imagine the majority of people who see black snake moan wont enjoy it due to the fact they wont be able to stop themselves from thinking how unlikely the situations are the depressing part about that is there are many other films with just as unlikely even more outrageous scenarios that are widely well received its the issues of race religious motives sexuality the film exhibits that will have more effect on opinion than anything the idea of a black man chaining a white woman up in his house is enough to make most people not even consider seeing it simply put its not for everyone like i said to fully enjoy it you have to go in with an open mind or else youre just wasting your money for those of you who can do that i highly recommend it,positive
it was very heart warming as an expatriated french i particularly enjoyed this tv movie which i think deserves a broader distribution the acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural french family seemed sostrong and so natural no doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and aids one of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son leo who has contracted hiv and the youngest son marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation the two charactersprogressively explore each other as time runs out for leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs,positive

this movie draws you in and gets you hooked on keeping your eyes on the screen the writer director is brilliant with the narrative parts and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives which all add to the gripping hold it will have on you insomniacs nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you have seen is it a dream or reality this indie will have you discussing the twists and turns it takes through the conscious and subconscious it has an eery feel with its dark interpretations of illusions dominic monaghan really became the insomniac he is a great actor who is not hard on the eyes either he really poured his whole being into this role from the storyline to the way it is shot makes this indie one of my favorites i recommend it highly and eagerly await to see more from this innovative creative writer director cinematographer,positive

oscar wildes comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of lord darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time jean crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy doubtless the hays office insisted premingers direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the screen version with helen hunt as mrs erlynne or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version,negative

this film is shoddily made unoriginal garbage i like romantic comedies sometimes watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner its not something you are going to do all the time but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time everything about it screamed made on the cheap it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets toothe writing was clunky i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy but you usually dont really care because you are laughing this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition sure this is how all movies work but you shouldnt notice that its happening inelegant thats the term i should usethere was almost no one in the movie who was really likable i didnt care who ended up with whom as long as they all stayed the hell away from me and i didnt have to listen to them talk about it anymore why would the only really cool character in the movie the paul rudd character want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy condescending control freak played by eva longoria also almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and bathe with with a woman he is attracted to the best feel good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudds equally annoying lying kleptomaniac sister lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive appealing women maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road,negative
before i saw this film i didnt really expect to much from it although my friend advised otherwise due to this request from my friend i decided i was really going to watch this film the minute i sat down to view the film i was absolutely blown away from the credits i was falling of my seat i just couldnt contain myself the film is about hitler in all the glory of comedy hynkel is the absolute double for the jewish barber who comes back from fighting in the war due to the heroics of the barber he manages to save one of the germans and by doing that gets a member of the enemy on board which helps in the struggle which the jews had but things went wrong and stolz was arrested but only then to escape to the confines of the jewish surburb the ghetto due to this escape the german army began searching which meant that the barber and stolz got arrested but again they escaped only to be mistaken for hynkel and consequently takes his poistion the speech that chaplin makes at the end is fantastic it complies the morals which society could only dream about in the speech it contradicts the whole meaning of the film because of the seriouness and sincerenity which it entailed and it definately works because i did walk out feeling guilty about how we live our lives looking at the smallest thing such as being ignorant to someone to the biggest most prominent things such as war,positive
alright i got passed the horrible acting i got passed the fact that lil kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands werent moving i got passed the weaves i got passed the colored contactsthis is what killed it for me in the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing lisa raye and monica calhoun stand up and and then lil kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying whoa whoa whoa hold up lets chill out here for a hot second i am a fan of the western movie genre and i never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of clint eastwoods moviesif anyone thinks this movie deserves over a rating please tell me another movie thats worse than gang of rosesim through,negative
this show is the worst show ever norris and his family write it produce it direct it etc etc the only reason i ever see it is because my goofy wife likes it how many times can norris fly though the air from plain sight to land a kick on an obviously blind villain no trees no building just whooshthin air he always solves the case or is the best at whatever skill there is no co star ever gets the glory its all norris its truly apparent that norris is awful stuck on himself and will not allow anyone to one up him in any scene no matter what the content terrible acting terrible script terrible series,negative
shame on fox for dumping this movie it was a total riot and i only hope that it will find a second life on dvd and cablethis is a hilarious satire it takes the what if situation to an extreme and it doesnt pull any punches or kicks to the groin it makes you think what is to become of this empire once weve gotten totally to lazy and stupid everyone gets hit in this one esp a number of major corporations and even fox news takes a punchwhich is probably why the movie never had a proper release other than the marketing department over thinking the campaign and not knowing how to market it so well just give up some may find the movie sophomoric due to the groin kicking and farting but the movie is much more than that you either get what mike judge is saying or you dont most of the negative reviews ive read seem to come from people who just dont get it or are film snobsitll probably play for one week in the selected markets so if you miss it keep an eye out for the dvd itll be worth the rental and i will eventually have it in my collectiongood job mike judge its a shame that you got screwed but you made me laugh out loud and i look forward to the next movie you do,positive
the thing is a milestone in movie making and remains one of my favourite films of all time despite the films roots in science fiction it is ultimately a horror film that brilliantly balances splatter with psychological trauma today over twenty five years after its release the special effects stand up as an example of sheer brilliance and effects man rob bottin suffered a complete physical breakdown for his art it would be impossible to make the same movie today as the studio would most certainly insist on casting a female character or a paul walker typean all male american science team in antarctica are thrown into turmoil when an alien lifeform able to perfectly absorb and imitate other lifeforms infiltrates their camp their trust in each other steadily crumbles as they become increasingly unsure who is real and who is an imitation and this body snatchers scenario sees their numbers steadily dwindle as one by one they fall victim to the thing when cornered it manifests itself as a different nightmarish creature the metamorphosis always horrific and compellingthe helplessness isolation and claustrophobia of a team of desperate men with no way out of their situation and no way of help reaching them is expertly sustained the long hours of darkness and the mounting snowfall provide a bleak backdrop to the terror that unfolds director john carpenter selected with great care a team of brilliant character actors and each member of the team fits perfectly into the part they play whether it be the young and street wise chef the elderly and wise doctor or the bitter and cynical helicopter pilot the point is that no one here comes close to being an all american badass superhero with blonde locks and a six pack and the films real strength is thanks in no small part to this stark realism the people suffering on screen are recognisable in our daily livesthe thing remains consistently enjoyable and affecting even after repeated viewings i have now seen the film on more than twenty separate occasions and my amazement at the quality of the direction the acting and the special effects is unwavering my girlfriend prefers the high school spin off of the film the faculty which is good and solid entertainment but far more light hearted and whistful she still loves and acknowledges the brilliance of the thing however and thank goodness for that because i could not remain in the company of someone who didnt love this moviea classic and then some,positive
forbidden planet rates as landmark in science fiction carefully staying within hard aspects of the genre science not fantasy ergo nerds will love it while still playing with imagery and ideas of contemporary s values morbiuss isolated house is a model of modern design with open spaces that step out into sculpted gardens a swimming pool and the ultimate home appliance robby the robot a housewifes dream exclaims the captain after lunch and a demonstration of the robots abilities to synthesize food and disintegrate wastealso revealing to the s fruedian psychology rears its head in the id explanation although morbius dismisses it as an outdated concept there is a touch of the pacific war drama in the battle with the invisible monster and life aboard the saucer perhaps most timely is the post atomic fear that science is the enemy and arrogant scientists will unwittingly bring down destruction in their blind quest for knowledgeyet the suburban drama presented by forbidden planet seems uniquely fresh in the sci fi genre they arent swashbucklers or heroes but ordinary sailors crossing the galaxy with a servicemans crudeness and honesty the good guys drive the flying saucer and the aliens are so long gone we dont even know what they looked like although their music er atmospheric tonalities by bebe and louis barron are remarkably futuristic today the views from morbius house are truly alien with jagged cliffs and pink bonsais the interior of the saucer is just this side of buck rogers theres a lot visually to like although we get fantastic monsters and robots for the kiddies forbidden planet is a cerebral movie slow paced and talky it is working on many levels at once hard sci fi against space adventure philosophical against domestic there are many suburban touches in spite of all their space talk the soldiers are dressed for the golf course morbius fatal discovery is a humble educational facility a schoolhouse the most interesting character is morbius daughter altaira having never seen a man she is unashamedly forward to the crew shes a post madonna teen who designs her own space age clothes and takes every opportunity to change outfits imagine christina aguilera with a household replicator men watching the film might see her as a naive girl in a minidress but every woman knows there is no such thing as a naive girl in a minidress anne francis deserves better recognition for humiliating the leut with kisses alas well never know if she was working him as he suspects since the captain interrupts and becomes a more interesting target for her attention she is the character who makes the important change in the film shocked that her father compares the dead doc to the other embeciles in his landing party she turns away from her father her home to leave with the sailors for earth its this act of defiance of maturity that sends morbius id creature over the edge allegorically destroying its creator just as it did thousands of centuries earlier to the krell maybe the krell had teenage daughters too,positive
i have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me i should see it as i am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies i got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now i would have been better off not remembering i even had itthis movie was atrocious the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was i know it was a story by clive barker and all and no i have not read that story but it appears to me that if you havent then you will be as i was completely clueless and utterly disappointedthe film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting the first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention i thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on i was wrong the blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a persons head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer wtf cgi blood did they even use any real blood at all my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadowsit just gets worse and worse i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake theres just too much add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the endno thank you it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway ok with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant plausible doableand a lot better i think than the real story that could have and should have worked instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book wellyou just wont ever understand it fiasco tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential if you like mindless fake blood and gore youll love this but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it stay away far far away,negative
i caught this movie a few years ago one night and it was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen however since it is supposed to be an action movie i cannot give it more stars since the humor was unintentionalchuck norris plays a truck driver who comes home from the road to see his family and within the first five minutes the conflict arises which leads chuck to seek vengeance for the rest of the film good thing too cuz the sub par acting by everyone involved was starting to get old very fast actually the judge was pretty good but i cant really describe what makes him work youll have to check it out for yourselfand the custom van chuck norris drives is hideously classic,negative
i thought this movie was absolutely hilarious i already knew it was going to be a funny movie but it was funnier than i expected sure there were some lame jokes but they cracked me up i thought the actors were going to turn out to be pretty bad but the actors were good in acting out this comedy i have to give kudos to amanda bynes she looked surprisingly like her brother and pulled off an awesome performance as a boy as for the other actors they were funny as well of course there were moments where you yell at the screen how can you not tell but thats all part of the fun in the end the plot turned out pretty well theres a happy ending but whatd you expect overalljust hilarious,positive
this is a really fun breezy light hearted romantic comedy you cannot go wrong with meg ryans cute perkiness combined with albert einsteins genius normally im not a fan of completely fabricated fictional tales about actual people now deceased and not able to defend themselves but i think the late einstein might himself have gotten a chuckle out of this oneits the sprinceton new jersey in the spring the story revolves around a pretty young scatter brained mathematician catherine meg ryan who is all set to marry a stuffy jerk a behavioral researcher named james merely because he has the brains shes looking for in the father of her future children however its love at first sight when her car breaks and she meets an auto mechanic named ed tim robbins as she doesnt think ed is intelligent enough her uncle none other than albert einstein plays match maker assisted in his endeavors by three mischievous cronies all theoretical physicists uncle albert must make ed appear suitably smart so concocts a charade portraying him as a physicistnaturally with amusing resultswalter matthau is his usual hilarious self and pulls off the character of einstein quite effectively with his three professorial buddies kurt nathan and boris a lot of laughs ensue the real einstein had a genuine human side and this film just takes it one outrageous step further if you suspend all logic you can almost imagine this silly story happeningit might not be rocket science despite its main character but it is a wonderful sweet refreshing movie one of the best of the comedy romance genre,positive
i never was an avid viewer of crocodile hunter but did occasionally see an episode or a bit of an episode and when the news spread about steve irwins death from a stingray attack in it certainly caught my attention this movie with steve and his wife terri playing themselves but in a fictional story was released in but i didnt hear of it until several years later and even after that it took me a while to get around to seeing it well now i have seen it and after looking here first more than once and seeing its rating i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be though it could have been a bit better apparently its supposed to be a comedy so a major problem with it is that it isnt very funny at alla us satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia where it is swallowed by a crocodile while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt and are unaware of whats inside it two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon the agents are assisted by jo buckley and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them on steve and terris mission they face other types of dangerous wildlife not just the crocodile and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it when steve sees the cia agents after them he mistakes them for poachers not only did i not laugh once while watching this film the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents apart from that i dont think i found anything even mildly amusing its also a bit of an incoherent mess switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters and it seems like clips from crocodile hunter and clips from an action thriller or something like that put together for some reason also added to that mix are the ranch scenes which also seem to be from somewhere else and as funny as brozzie drewitt played by magda szubanski is supposed to be shes not at one point we see her farting so we have a fart joke a major cliché in modern comedy are they so hard to resist i also found the typical crocodile hunter scenes with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers to be tedious but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show didnt helpsteve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist and is sadly missed by them while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him no matter which side youre on the crocodile hunter collision course is not a well crafted movie im sure it does help if youre a big steve irwin fan but even if you are theres no guarantee that you would like this movie as some fans clearly havent been impressed in fact it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have so maybe it wont help like i said theres no guarantee i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show this movie was unnecessary the attempt to combine what is usually seen in crocodile hunter with a fictional story unfortunately failed and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes,negative
after watching avalon which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx and several anime films written by oshii including jin roh which is fantastic i decided i should check out the oshii cinema trilogy box set being that the red spectacles and stray dog are related i will comment here on both and let me tell you it was one of the biggest wastes of money i have spent in a while i first watched stray dogs and then the red spectacles i am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies i have ever seen for only about minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters who are only dressed in the panzer cop outfits for a few fleeting scenes the rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations i really dont understand the motivation behind these two films at all i love the wolf brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot but the films themselves leave much to be desired i would suggest not watching these films and certainly do not buy the box set like i did unless you enjoy wasting money oh and if you are wondering what i think about the rd movie in the set talking head i couldnt even bring myself to watch it before i purged the box set from my dvd collection via ebay at a loss if you want cool japanese live action check out returner or ichii the killer or the zeiram series,negative
request you to not watch this movie it starts with a promise and as it goes on you crave for the movie to end predictablenot entertaining at allwasted movie save your time and watch better thrillers the synopsis sounds good and that is why i watched the movie but it was way too predictable with nothing to give you a start no great suspense no great direction nothing phenomenal with the acting shy away from this low rating nothing to write about this movie so i am filling up the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much a time waster this movie isreally irritated at how good a premise that was and how bad a screenplay was written out of it,negative
i still havent gotten to see all of this its running on cable right now and i seem to keep coming in on the middle of it my main reason for being interested in it is that im a bill paxton fan hes a pretty good actor and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his careerthe other thing is that while never really a fan of the old series i kinda liked thunderbirds for the ships and effect work derek meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies and his designs for the international rescue craft are wonderful the current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screenbutthis is one lame story the kids are asked to drive it and while they do an okay job its hard to suspend your disbelief especially when you have brains eight year old son flying t an enormous multi ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a buick everywhere you look you see a ford logo product placement is way over the top here and its annoying ben kingsley does an good job as the hood but he can only do so much with a one dimensional role if you can accept the film on its very slim merits thunderbirds is a fun enjoyable ride just dont look too closely at the machinery that drives itaddendum i finally got to see all of this and its worse than i thought the acting is fairly uniformly poor and while the effects are fairly good the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier the overdone product placement for ford is annoying and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves as with the avengers if you ignore the source material its bearable but not very watch the original show and youll see what i meanand a word of advice to jon frakes take a refresher course at the directors guild you can do better than this old friendanother footnotei saw this again last night on telemundo dubbed in spanish with cheesy comedy sound effects and yes i came in roughly in the middle with ben ron and sophia in their fight scene on tracy island i didnt think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse but it was it was embarrassingly bad if this had been done straight no kids to the rescue no tongue in cheek jokes it might have worked as it is its just another beloved childhood joy thats been ruined,negative
watching this odd little adventure movie its hard to believe that it was directed by the same man who brought us such high quality giallo classics as the strange vice of mrs wardh and the case of the scorpions tail but it has to be said that despite its low quality production values island of the fish men is an entertaining ride and one that surely deserves more praise than its getting like many italian films from the seventies this is one is a rip off of a successful american film the one in question this time being the critically panned island of dr moreau sergio martinos film takes ideas such as mutation greed and adventure and moulds it into one slightly compelling film which makes up for what its lacks in coherency and logic with a load of mostly intriguing ideas the central plot follows a boat which crashes on a small island it quickly becomes apparent that not everything about this place is normal and it soon transpires that half of the population has been turned into fish men a cross between a man and a fish which exist for purely selfish reasonsthe truth about this movie is that its a lot more fun if you ignore the trashy production values the central monsters look completely ridiculous and much of the movie takes place on sets that look like they cost someone a few pennies but the movie is well shot in spite of this with the underwater photography being a particular highlight and the pacing of the movie is well done in that the film never becomes boring the way that the plot comes together isnt exactly genius but it takes in a lot of ideas and ive seen films made on plots with much less thought put into them than this one the biggest location standout in the film is definitely the lost city of atlantis to be honest im not a massive fan of adventure movies and therefore dont see this lost city get mentioned much but it is always nice to see it in a movie the central island location is good in that it provides an apt setting for the story and also provides the movie with the right amount of mystery as martino makes good use of the voodoo theme overall this isnt exactly a classic and there are certainly a lot worse trashy adventure movies out there than this one,positive

the original vampires is one of my favorites i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters i was quite surprised at how this played out as a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes vampire lore from the first one in tact jon bon jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half way decent slayer i doubt anyone could top james woods performance in the first one though unless you bring in buffyall in all this was a decent watch i would watch it againi was left with two questions though what happened to jack crow how did derek bliss come to be a slayer guess well just have to leave that to imagination,positive

youll know what i mean after youve seen red eye overall red eye was a better than expected thriller it gets off to a slow start and slowly builds but by the time it was over its a thumper its hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as i found it except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie that says a lotother factors i think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim a scant out of more like a but thats pretty good,positive

it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it unravels into a direction less mess who is the main character is this a serious film or some gregg araki esquire over the top goofy film is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted i have no clue i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came i cut a good minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the haves have nots i got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends wassup felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage caveman which larry didnt write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didnt take itself seriously wassup rockers was just plain bad,negative
a very funny movie michael douglas do is worth watching this flick for if for no other reason id like to see him do more of these low life roles he was terrific as were all the performersthe film struck me right off as an american roshomon only funnier and easier to watch because it was in american and didnt need no stinkin subtitlesin a funny movie with a laugh every minute or so two of the best were with john goodman not someone i am crazy about he is telling the priest about jewel doing something he liked and says i had to wipe the smile off my face the visual shows he is not smiling and clearly is a guy who never smiles but probably doesnt know it the scene at the end between goodman all suited up for jewel in his cop uniform and grappling with the be leathered reiser hunched over a table and the two of them then protesting that they are not gay to another character who happens on the scene this alone deserved a special comedy academy award,positive
in what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending at no time did i ever feel sympathy for diane lane or anna paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life nor did i feel for the emasculated liev shrieber the story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning diane lane topless heres a hint it occurs about minutes into the film fast forward to that part and skip the rest,negative

not everything is said in this excellent first feature from céline sciamma the friendship the wanting to fit in the first sexual feelings all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenesall three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to say thirteen but a very worthwhile trip nonethelessa must see and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door the soundtrack is a by the waybon cinéma,positive

after having seen this show a few times i am thoroughly offended as a female that there are so many stupid women out there that fall for this bullshit im a little more mature than some of the players in this show but am still appalled that the whole dating game has been boiled down to a gameshow where goofy dudes can score points on their lame ass attempts to pick up chicks if young guys are watching this and using it as a learning manual dont save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass maybe there are girls out there with the same mind setbut some how i dont think so,negative
considering its popularity i found this movie a huge disappointment maybe i was expecting too much from this film after all it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the s but i could never figure out why the story is uninteresting it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for since the intended hero is an idiot director chang has no sense of style and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative i know this is not supposed to be high art but i found the movie boring definitely not the best example of this much beloved genre its cult status escapes me i recommend you to skip it,negative
time for a rant eh i thought spirit was a great movie to watch however there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a or im being a little bit generous with the point matt damon aggravates me i was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when i first heard him narrate and then i realized it is matt damon the man bugs me so very bad his performance in the departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but thats another story for some other time as it almost did spirit i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfullypoint brian adams sucks the whole score was terrible the songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did i find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible every time one of the lame songs came on i was turned off i almost thought id start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics i couldnt help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after in light of the native american aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio hit teen bop year old girl crap i thought i was back in junior high school i cant believe no better could have been done i refuse to had it not have been for this id rank the film up more with disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok dont bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking too bad its a shame they couldnt have hired better musiciansi liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thick dark lines mainly near the end there were often times when i thought they tried too hard on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion but there were also times when the emotion ran thick anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparentok im falling asleep here so ill sum it up before i start making less sensenice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though matt damon you suck,positive

i know no one cares but i do this film is historic for one reason it is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci fi films well one is great and one is quite bad the great one is truly great in fact its the best the bad one is truly bad in fact its the worst of course of the great i refer to star wars and its star mark hamill aka luke skywalker who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his vette swiped and then goes to vegas on a lead and after a whole lot of adventures eventually recovers it since hes into fixing cars i guess you can call him lube skywalker along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold and ends up facing off with a character played by kim milford the hero from the seventies sci fi cult film laserblast which is as ive hinted at earlier the worst sci fi film ever made milford plays the lead baddie whom hamill must steal his car back from i realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci fi heroes but i do and i also must say that this is one of the best worst movies of all time mark hamills acting needs the force the plot needs extensive jedi training and the character of the hooker played by annie potts just might be the most annoying character of all time ever in any film ive ever seen but its a fun movie to watch on a weekend day or a weekday night late at night very late its one of those films that meanders looking for something but without quite finding it and yet at the same time its entire purpose is like free form jazz to simply exist as is and it does and what is isnt that great but you cant say it isnt entertaining because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off but you wont feel cheated so turn off your mind relax and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations and may the force be with you always,negative
first off mexican werewolf in texas title is misleading as many others have pointed out it is actually about el chupacabra which is a similar creature to a werewolf but by no means the samethe production and editing just plain suck when it was over i probably wouldnt be able to give a very accurate description of what exactly the chupacabra looked like for whenever it was in a scenedespite one or two exceptions the camera turned all shaky and you could only see the monsters face clearly the special effects were laughably bad but that has to be expected from a low budget horror moviealong with the terrible production comes the bad actors now a couple give fairly plausible performanceserika fay and martine hughes but then there were the bad actorseverybody else who seemed to have no emotions whatsoever when people died then theres the absolutely terrible actorsara erikson who gives one of the worst performances ive ever seen in a movie i mean my god she was indescribably badthe plot was very simple basically a chupacabra is in a small texan town killing off local residents and a group of teens look to stop it however even with the plot being this simple a few plot holes managed to leak throughanyways horrible movie however if you are looking for a movie to make fun of and laugh at with your friends one night this would be a pretty good one my friends and i had a good time watching this probably the nd worst movie ive ever seen awful,negative
my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes the characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing the story is made up of mini plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan,positive
i looked at this movie with my child eyes and i wasnt disappointed the story is well known some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio mamooth sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal and i dont want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut this one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picturebriefly it works it is funny and it is a must see with your children theyll like it,positive
arg the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all awful third film this time european terroristsirish id say hi jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium they pull into a shipyard open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists the cops and some marines the whole film seems to be again largely inspired from alienas carnosaur was with the pathetic marines going through the claustrophobic shipyard guns at the ready this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marines head off the dinos are stiff shuffling creatures as usual and the t rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roarsit also appears to have no eyes one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck on opening it surprise the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside what was the point of filming this scene oh bother who cares both thumbs down for the over sized rubber iguanas,negative
im dumbfounded yes thats right im really caught here no way did i find it awful but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency the idea behind such a trim minimal low budget indie production isnt bad but its a confused muddle and in the end didnt do anything for me its amateurish and simple it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style we have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight scared they flee and not too long that one light suv appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game as for being disturbing i guess that depends some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also i found myself snickering too in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs freely but its not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up too many cringe moments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about set pieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern the performances jennifer barnett angela brunda danielle lilley sandra paduch and mia yi are workman like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the scripts weaknesses in its character foundation veronica garcias flipped out bug eyed intensity as the loony driver of the suv was something yeah something her characters real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non existent i guess being psychotic was good enough now probably the most unnerving thing i came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack terrible techno music to cheesy hard rock and an overwrought closing score it never felt overdone or got in the way but it did stick out like a sore thumb co directors greg swinson and ryan thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle maybe it was enjoyable to make but watching it just wasnt the case,negative
this is a wonderful look you should pardon the pun at women talking about breasts theirs their mothers other womens and how they affect so many aspects of their lives young girls old women and everyone in between with all shapes sizes configurations etc talk about developing reacting celebrating hiding enhancing or reducing their breastsits charming delightful sad funny and everything in between intercut with documentary footage and clips from those famous old young womens films that the girls got taken to the cafeteria to see the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women their breasts into what the other half has to say when they dont know youre listening,positive

this is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts as a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are a fan of pre code films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out even if they arent married and even if their partner is the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets a scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded to almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this timesurprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it tacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate and as a result of all this violence miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writerbut then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside dunne meets a judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as a very good girl even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being a crooked judge he assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes a scoundrel using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released the film then endsso we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early s idea of what a nice girl should be like i gathered that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really undoes all the positives about dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film a strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with a decent re write this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film,negative
most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar none and theyre right curly is a scream dressed up in drag as senorita cucaracha and moe and larry are in top form as senor mucho and senor gusto respectively christine mcintyres beautiful operatic voice is given full rein she actually was a trained opera singer and its wonderful the great gino corrado is hilarious as a pompous italian singer terrorized by the stooges at a society party some truly funny gags good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the stooges prolific output whats even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time and in several of the shorts he made during this period you can see that he is obviously ill his timing is way off he speaks very slowly and haltingly and has trouble getting around fortunately his health was in an upswing when he made this film and it shows classic stooge comedy and enjoyed by even non stooge fans i had a girlfriend who couldnt stand the stooges but even she laughed at this one a must see,positive
i am seldom motivated to write a review unless inspired by the quality of the movie in the case of comanche moon i was so uninspired i felt the need to warn others how bad this tv mini series is here are a few thoughtsthe indians they came across like they were in a saturday night live skit making fun of how indians talk when mcmurtry writes dialogue in his novels it reads so interesting i am not sure how they ended up with what they gotgus mccrae looks like festus from the old gunsmoke series acting is ok and the mannerisms from robert duvalls mccrae are right on but the look is pure comedy cowboyclara maybe you could use a little dirt or sweat on her next time ever been in austin in the summer before air conditioning i promise you women did not look like that do you think they never saw any episodes of dearwoodgov elisha pease again whenever they are in the governors office it feels like a saturday night live skit and the skit is bombingwoodrow call call is the most reasonable character of course he talks so little how can you screw up that but hey what about that hatblue duck see above and include the fact that he isnt even a tiny bit scary they should have gotten javier bardem to play the partthe rangers right out of o brother where art thou i expected george cloony to come riding up and them to break into a songperhaps i am premature because the miniseries isnt completed but i doubt i will watch any more of it any wayi would not expect anyone to be able to duplicate the enthralling feel of lonesome dove but i watch this and it seems like they have no feel for the old west at all,negative
as a big fan of the original film its hard to watch this show the garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake the mood is never there instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the seventies crenna is not a bad choice as walter neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment dont fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting characterhe does his best to make it work but samantha egger is a really bad choice the english accent and california looks cant hold a candle to barbara stanwicks velvet voice and sex appeal lee jcobb tries mightily to fashion barton keyesbut even his performance is just gruff without styleit feels like the tv movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is,negative
immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago a friend and i decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale there was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was to this day we still rate movies even very bad ones by how much better than the lonely lady they area long time ago i saw an interview with eleanor perry who wrote the screenplays for among other things last summer and diary of a mad housewife and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the harold robbins book the lonely lady she said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didnt think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in hollywood she then said i think they got someone else to write it the interview was filmed before the movie was released she died in and i bet the first thing she did on arrival in heaven was personally thank god for saving her from involvement in the result,negative
this is a very good movie i give it a its very different in that its kind of a long stalking scene all the way through the fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable wayshe sees a murder for a snuff movie and decides to run but is chased this takes quite some time i wont reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience but rest assured its very believable well played very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great endingdont miss this movie,positive
art imitates life imitates art atticus finch is reincarnated into the da in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who done it and how did it happen the authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again the music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience,positive
i really liked this picture because it realistically dealt with two people in love and one of them having a disorder though the ending saddened me i know that that was the best way for it to finish off i would recommed this to everyone,positive
although there were a few rough spots and some plot lines that werent exactly true to character this was classic hlots the characters outside of mike giardello giancarlo esposito were true to form and the reunion scenes of pembleton andre braugher and bayliss kyle secor were as deep and well acted as anything ever to grace the small screenhomicide the movie aka life everlasting is a fan flick but stands on its own as well as any hour episode of the series fontana overmeyer and yoshimura did a wonderful job in pulling loose ends from seasons and every major cast member of the best damn show on television together for the series finale that nbc never bothered to give it true to homicide form there were no happy endings such is life thats what has always set this show apart from the mindless cookie cutter cop shows left on television kudos to the writers and the cast for creating something over the span of the series and in the movie that challenged television viewers and producers alike i call myself a homicidal maniac if for no other reason than to keep my co workers in a cooperative mood,positive
yes this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes then they introduce jinx a robot that could not possibly exist in as they do not have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kids kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not have the signal to reach into space this camp is also not very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not doing the right things give it a rest they are there for fun not to become astronauts just yet just give them the experience of space flight not a military like camp however you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me probably for a few others as well who else would like to see kate capshaws face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature,negative
a couple move into their dream home unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery the film is said to have been based on a true story although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed the plot is hardly unique see spielbergs poltergeist within a short time they experience various supernatural phenomena these range from the disturbing mysterious shadows the serious illness of the daughter to the frankly ridiculous toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control there is little depth to the story once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery we do not learn anything more the plot does not seem to develop the characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable nor is the atmosphere particularly special the film could be disturbing to some viewers there is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it,negative

set in the the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton gerard depardieu at his finest and robespierre a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre danton walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the danton affair written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris,positive
the show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs people frown upon the show due to its perverted idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization but truth be told practically every young guy is out doing it at the club overall the show really appeals to the younger population as we like to see the outcome of a players performance at the club as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel a cool fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact good job boys,positive

i finally found a version of persuasion that i like anne doesnt look like a scullery maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like shes described in the book captain wentworth doesnt look like hes nor does he look perpetually angry but rather as hes described in the book he hasnt aged as much as anne and is quite handsome and they play their parts with such conviction and realismthats what acting is all about they were believable they created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life if you havent seen this version i urge you to find it order it or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you must its worth the price and worth the wait i watched the version and the version and this one towers over the other two why it isnt rated higher is beyond my comprehension the book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life,positive
just watched hair after a lapse of years it struck home for those of us who tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power who resisted the fascism of the johnson nixon administrations who now as veterans of civil wars fought the war in vietnam every single day until finally the us beast died and fled for all who said no in many different ways its remarkable how unsuccessful we were how large the real table was on which treat danced how driven the wizard behind the curtain we were we didnt know the nature of the enemy the size of the monster who for the next thirty years and counting would continue to eat the world how could we even with smoke and the bat the bat in our hand like treat we were too young too middle class too invested too much a part of the actions we hatedbut there was a moment as andre gregory observes in my dinner with there was a moment or two somewhere back there in the late s and early s when perhaps we could have found something besides the yellow brick road something not fueled by bechtel prisons enron and dick something collaborative something innocent and critical at once something with dancebut we missed it like kong bending a girder the revolution was turned in on itself into sexism racism homophobia and class crushing politics until we got to w treat would have hated w and iraq and the pathological lies if they were in that film then but the moment passed and w was almost inevitable comprehensive incompetence riding the drunken raging bull into estuaries childrens lives and china shopswe should have done something more something better but we clearly didnt know whatnow what,positive
i dont know why i picked this movie to watch it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different every once in a while its good to try a film thats slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero thriller flick and this film certainly was different right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldnt figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being and are left with the things are going to be ok type of a feeling im sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance,positive
why is impossible to write in french very kitch this journey in the center of the earth is despicable technical possibilities nevertheless current in these big casimir of monsters is completely ridiculous the film deserve however a remake as was king kong the last one with a little more supplied scenario the professor has resemblances with the professor calculus and is rather funny david the character is enough inconsistent but crossspend to the people from below a good message you unite and will overcome you altogether we would say a film made in the s now that i said everything or almost the evil of which i thought of it we can say that if we have the brain get tired or anything has to see of the other one then the thingmatter is even rather entertaining hugh such is my opinion translating french to english with reverso sorry for possible mistakes,negative
i guess this is in the public domain as its out on dvd first off this is a feel good propaganda movie to be shown to a wartime aussie audience so its not to be considered a serious retelling of tobruk the first half to is very dry stuff set in australia i guess like many american war films where the recruits are getting together oh man its soooo long than we get to africa and tobruk pretty bad low budget stuff the battle scenes on the dvd copy i watched were almost completely black see it if you must but be prepared to use the fast forward as i doubt you can take it after a few minutes i enjoyed the cheesy italian battle of el alamien a whole lot more also richard burton did an african theater war flick that was good the desert rats this movie is just a real period piece and should have stayed in that time does not hold up well today i doubt it was highly regarded back then either i say the same thing about my american counterpart war flicks so dont take it personally aussies i love australia been there twice,negative
being featured at the cannes film festival and gaining quite some fame this movie appears to be another modern and profound school drama its about a bunch of adolescents who get through a revealing and desperate day at school everythings circling around a suicide shown at the very beginning to some extent that happens at pm the characters are somehow all connected with each other what moves them is described via short interview sequences strictly shot in b w the characters are well written the acting is intriguing especially teresa palmer as melody and frank sweet as marcus are discoverieslets stick to the movies technique thats what really impressed me there rarely are cuts most of the time the camera follows one of the protagonists like in gus van sants elephant some scenes are presented more often than once but each time from a different point of view here character this surely evokes a slowly developing but grabbing atmosphere that drags you inside literally the colours are vibrant somehow unfitting considering the tough plot but thats nothing less than a clever contrast a disturbing everythings fine thing the use of lighting is adequate all the time underlining the characters actual mood and finally there are decent placements of music somehow itches you from the very beginning it does not compromise nor does it serve laughter it rather strings together what psychologists would define as terror moments this movie substantially focuses on emotional precipices there aint nobody whos not to handle some kind of neurosis even the depicted minor parts eg the teachers seem to be in some state of disorder and that is what keeps this movie from being really good its summing up of piercing tragedies is unrealistic to its very bones there is no friendship love smiling truth passion there is faking humiliation despair sickness and beating up its like being hit in the face real hard all the time but you are numb after the first hour this flick keeps on hitting you until it reveals something quite instructive in the endfor being sensitively and superbly acted for being technically innovative and original for being unidimensional makes a solid out of,positive

where do i start the plot of the movie which is about a love between two high school students during wartime while one is a living weapon and their struggle to maintain that love is a very good plot it is based on a manga by shin takahashi which was also turned into an anime in both of which i have yet to read or seethis review is about this live action adaptation however sadly this honest to goodness was a terrible movie it isnt as if one could site certain aspects and say for instance the budget is at fault or the acting is to blame it is sadly a series of underwhelming and ineffectual elements that bring this film downthe acting is poor not to say aki maeda and shunsuke kubozuka are bad actors but they didnt have much to work with and seemed miscast neither seemed to have the physical range to draw the viewer in the story as well as being too old for their parts to a distracting degreethe script was weak the leads act unrealistically and behave irrationally the film also plays for the heartstrings but ends up being predictable all the while not being compelling and under developing the characters there are also pacing issuesvisually it is unremarkable the film uses green screen heavily and unnecessarily in too many scenes the other special effects also have a cheap look to them especially where minimalistic practical special effects could have been used there is also no visual flair as if there were no cinematographer or art designer to make the scenes look consistent and stimulatingthe music and sound effects were fine but unremarkableoverall the movie isnt devoid of enjoyment and fans of the series shouldnt be discouraged to see it at least once just for the sake of completion people unfamiliar with saikano this probably isnt the place to jump in as it isnt a very good movie or melodrama it isnt the movie or the cast and crews fault it just isnt inspired and that is what kills it,negative
i dont want to spoil the movie for anyone but this mimics lifes reality in so many ways and if you are really honest with yourself you will resonate with it in agreement in at least a few of the scenesthe acting is not only believable but convincing in a way that endears one to the characters moreover its funny without trying too hard at itand yes i truly believe a sequel is warranted here see the movie youll understand whyhighly recommended especially if you like movies that have a real message,positive
i voted this a out of simply because it is the best animated story i have been able to see in quite some time the animation is stunning the artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful from the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry i was amazed moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand im impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family,positive
i dont get it the teenage leads in horror star supposedly all are devoted horror fans yet when their favorite idol conrad radzoff passes away they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it like disco dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it that doesnt sound like something real horror fans would do now does it im a big horror fan and i immensely idolize departed icons like vincent price peter cushing and boris karloff but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory no wonder conrad comes back from the dead admittedly after a séance to wipe them all off the face of the earth mr radzoff already wasnt known for his friendliness in life since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets horror star aka frightmare and body snatchers is a pretty lame s horror flick but there are a handful of cheesy gory highlights to enjoy the film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot since no one not even a film school student is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think hell get away with it and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through conrads video speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive one teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one jeffrey combs in one of his first roles loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence in the absolute messiest sequence a poor girl head is crushed by a coffin writer director norman thaddeus vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister the locations and scenery are great but vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing job the acting performances are overall decent with ferdy mayne imitating christopher lee and jeffrey combs delivering the most memorable roles horror star can hardly be called a must see or even a good film but its worth tracking down in case youre an admirer of enthusiastically made b horror,negative
to be honost with you i think everything was so good in this movie there should be no reason why it didnt go into theatersthe deaths in the movie are awesome the fx are awesome when usedthere are a few dull moments when the storys following the little girl but all in all this was a very good movie that i hope someday gets the props it shouldthe very first part of the movie is prob why it came straight to video with them killing a little boy but after that the story is based on a little girl and her mother who came to visit the moms boyfriend who moved out to try to become a writerthe property he buys turns out to be where the witchtooth fairylives and anyone who live in her house or goes on her property will be in great danger dont wanna give anything really away just a little info if youve wanted to see this movie then do so its worth the price of the rental,positive
this movie was great and i would like to buy itthe boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribethe eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer but this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to himand at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he wasplease if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me knowi havent seen it for over yearsbut still remember parts of the moviedeniselaceyyahoocom,positive
this movie was outright painful for me to watch i understand that indie films do not have the same resources as other mainstream films but there are basic elements of film making that typically you want to adhere to first off jump cuts there are numerous in the films opening minutes there are shots in which it appears that two separate takes of the same shot were edited together what i mean by this is a character will say half a line from one take and the rest of the line is from a different take secondly the dialog i understand that many writers strive for a very realistic and true dialog for their films since this film is very specific to its location the dialog must be spoken in a specific tone also example set a movie in boston yet people use west coast slang with a chicago accent even with understanding this it is still hard to sit through some of the lines these actors present these are only the two most vivid problems i encountered with this film there were a few others i do not mean to sound like a harsh critic who doesnt know a thing i have years of experience in the film more importantly the low budget indie film industry i also understand that with many directors there is often a method to their madness i have been unable to discover this method used in this film this makes it difficult when trying to decide whether i view this film as an example of unique style in film making or just another low budget poorly put together film i honestly hope that it is not the latter if anyone has any insight into why things were done a certain way or has any thoughts views of their own concerning this film i would love to hear them hopefully i can understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed,negative
i watch this movie all the time ive watched it with family ages to and everyone in between they all loved it it really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet just beautifulits great for thoes who love comedy movies the tear jerker movies or even just petsthe music is wonderful the animals spectacular the scenes truly thought out and the characters perfect what i liked about the characters is the true and nicely mixed personalities shadow the oldest a golden retriever hes the wise one filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog chance the american bulldog puppy is basically a puppy with a witty side the comical character and sassy the hymilayan cat shes the real cat who shows what a real cat will do for their owner the real girly one,positive
okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes theyve made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on screen the influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength the show has pushed barriers with its various story lines depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way but that is what star trek is and was all about it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly yes they have used some characters from trek history but they have done them justice characters like shelby lefler and necheyev vastly underused in the show had a rebirth in the new frontier books but they lost their sizzle after a while when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci fi and hf shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved they release bloopers for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide eyed in shock what this series now drawing to a close after years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing bringing people together inspiring others to do the same hf will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place,positive
i think the weighted average for this film is too low i give it a very entertaining although over the top in a few places my wife says it passes the danielle steele test superb performances throughout particularly by andie macdowell,positive
this movie is an insult to all submariners it was stupid it appeared to have been written by monkeys the acting was absurd if this is the view most people have of the navy then i weep for our defense this movie was awful i put it below voyage to the bottom of the sea as far as submarine movies go gene hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap denzel washington must have been high little in the plot makes any sense and the ending for a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime only hollywood would think of this garbage if you havent figured it out yet i didnt like it and if it wasnt for all the pro comments i would not have bothered to post,negative
mystery men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time there is a naive innocence and niceness to the characters it has become part of our family culture and we quote the characters often it is my favorite film of the last two years my kids are and and we all three love this film great acting and comedy we love galaxy quest and monty python flicks too okay were not talking intellectual here just family bonding,positive
for those of you out there who have seen this pic on vhs i would recommend the dvd in fact the vhs is utter rubbish the main reason is that the film was shot widescreen and the producers ran out of money making the vhs version and released it as the result is that several actors are not on screen at all and in many drag races less than half the cars are showing since one is on each side of the screen the dvd is actually a reasonable version of the filma lot of the best scenes in the film were cut before the final release they were viewed as being too offensive to minority groups in fact the prospect of a us release caused even more cuts in the film for example the americans reputedly did not understand words such as petrol strides mikes dad and mum were meant to be hippies the dad survives in the film as a wasted dope smoking guitarist but the following scene with the mum was cut the scene took place in the roof space of the house which was lined with aluminium foil fluoro lights and filled with plants you get the picture the producers had rounded up a lot of real plants for the foreground and when they saw the result on the big sheet they freaked and the scene was cut cowardsyes the film is noted as an australian cult classic voted in street machines best films of all time narrowly missing out to mad max ll the latter had over times the budget of roe in fact the budget on roe was so small that the director could not afford to wreck any of the cars even though there would have been a public outcry if anyone had wrecked a real ho compare that with smoky and the bandit or blues bros where dozens of cars were wrecked so theres one real gtho and two fakes one of the fakes was bought from the local indigenous community in cobar after the standby gtho crashed into the back of the country boys truck that was unscripted the car was meant to burst out from the side of the truck because the budget was so tight the car was made up with ordinary brown masking tape instead of the painted on gold trim of the real thingthe chev is absolutely real the car began as a very plain door and was brilliantly and quickly converted to the blown in the film the motor was a marinised which made around bhp this was reduced to around for the filming the car was able to easily to mph as show in several scenes in the film just for the record anyone with could have picked up all the cars after the film the ho the dodge the ute rammers chev the lot wonder where they are nowsw,positive
well i watched this film expecting to be rolling in the aisles how wrong i was the film was moderately amusing at best and irritating at worst the slapstick comedy styling of building an ark with archaic tools laugh no i didnt im very disappointed given steve carrel was the lead ive watch the office us religiously cracks me up immensely i thought year old virgin was good but evan elp us why on earth did he accept this script and as for morgan freeman hes old enough to know betterso the idea seemed reasonable the actors i had every faith in but the execution was nothing to write home about and the ending well it seemed as if they had run out of money or ideas this for me was one of the most contrived endings i could have imagined they took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a cautionary tale on localized environmental issues not even global issues but a local bill yawnin summary reasonable start got gradually worse and for me it was all washed out by the time the credits rolled,negative
i attended a screening of fierce people at the woodstock film festival i hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort since it was shot in the spring of and had its world premiere at tribeca in it played several festivals that year release seemed imminent then it disappeared poof vanished or so it appeared to the film going public rumors of a theatrical or dvd release have popped up now and then but all proved unfounded then this screening was announced perhaps one can call it a re premiere it certainly felt as if i was witness to a buried treasure and what a treasure it wasi suppose one could characterize fierce people as a coming of age drama but it also has elements of comedy and tragedy as well as mystery and a bit of farce thrown in in short real life that makes it hard to pigeonhole which puts it more into the category of an indie as opposed to a hollywood movie but its high production values big budget feel and star caliber cast seem at odds with the indie label so lets call it a hybrid and perhaps thats why its been lost it defies categorizationmeet finn earl anton yelchin whose father is absent in fact finn has never known him but he sees him and hears him via the collection of home movies sent from south america dad is a renowned anthropologist and has made a name for himself by setting up shop with the yanomani the tribe of fierce people who live to kill and well procreate all their activities are built around those two tasks and finn is captivated by it mom liz diane lane is also somewhat absent although present physically she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol so finn becomes an adult in his little solitary world with his reels of filmone summer mom decides to drag finn along with her into the wilds of new jersey a massage therapist mom has catered to a wealthy client ogden c osborne donald sutherland in a tour de force performance and he has invited her for an extended house call at his palatial estate osbornes tribe includes an assortment of eccentric rich kids servants and village idiots among whom finn will find himself part of his own anthropological study will his experience with dads films help him survive life as a visitor to this tribe will he be accepted or will he be seen as an outsider concurrently struggling with his own identity as an adolescent such is the stuff of fairy tales and i suppose this would be if not for the dark underbelly which director griffin dunne and writer dirk wittenborn have infused into this magnificent storywith anton yelchins voice over intercutting pieces of dads home movies finn must learn to go back to being the teenager he never really had a chance to be stop being the parent to his mom allow newly sober mom to be parent to him and learn responsibility on the way to adulthood the way it should have taken place all along yet he needs to make this transformation in a dangerous dark world where playing with fire is folly to this fractured familythis is first and foremost a story driven film and griffin dunne emphasized as much in the intro to the film he bought the rights to wittenborns novel even as it was being written and wittenborns own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterful dunne in a way thats a work of wonderthis is also largely a character driven film and sutherland has never been better his star turn as osborne stunned those around me and will likely leave you amazed as well diane lanes character ultimately exhibits so many personalities that its hard to imagine another actor pulling it off so well she is breathtaking but more than anything fierce people is anton yelchins film he has a long resume as a child actor but preciously little as a teen other than the little known house of d also a gem he is best known as byrd on tvs huff in january he will be seen in alpha dog also sitting on the shelf since a film i saw at sundance this year and in which he is the heart and soul his performance here goes far beyond what one would expect from someone so young and is nothing short of spectacularthis complex quirky film has remained out of sight long enough fierce people is a treasure filled with light and shadow comedy and tragedy joy and pathos but mostly wonder,positive
spoilers strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film allow me to add balance by pointing out the followingscript dreadful as tom and dan are getting to know each other bantering about films the talk is clearly that of one person and i suspect it was the director who carefully worked his words to sound intelligent at one point dan asks have you heard of the hiv virus and it sounds about as natural as asking have you communicated with the nine alien racesacting white teeth do and a chiseled face do not a sensitive performer make speedman did well enough with what he was given i suppose but marsden was terrible unsympathetic unbelievable and downright smug and smarmy throughout his captivity there is an emptiness to his performances also see interstate plot spare me the moments of half escape were not thrilling but irritating and weak recall marsden pretending to try keys in the door and then throwing them down they dont work man tee hee and beware the semi black and white flashbacks which are initiated with some schlocky sound taken from csi and other crime dramas most important of all most dangerous evil and offensive is the homophobia external or internal you decide in a film in which hiv is considered a weapon tom says that dan may have taken off the condom or not used it at all excuse me where was tom while they were having sex there is some villainizing of the inserting partner which comes off as a villainizing of the gay man in generalin sum beware,negative

this one is just like the th movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one liners are bad and are something that shouldnt be in a noes movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the th one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating,negative
warningi advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this commentif you plan on watching this movie dont i warn you this movie is terribly boring and basically horrifying not in the horror movie kind of way to watch i mistook this piranha movie for another piranha movie and when i had noticed i made a mistake i decided to watch this one anyway i wish i wouldnt have this movie is so horrendous and so intolerable in every piece of material that i couldnt bare to let anyone say this movie was halfway decent for one thing this movie should be called a boring talk about wilderness instead of piranha they only show piranhas once at the same time the way this film sounds so poorly heard i got sleepy only minutes into the thing at the end my mouth was hung wide open and i stared gloomily at the blank tv screen it is a very poorly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that i was afraid i brain dysfunction after watching it,negative
if i wouldnt have had any expectations of this film it might have received a or as it stands i give it a the acting is poor the factual accuracy of the drugs it discusses is lacking and i feel no empathy whatsoever for the charactersi watched adam paul immediately before watching this film and i both laughed and cried on several occasions this film did not strike even a similar chord the directors of human traffic may have some off hand experience of ecstasy but there is no demonstration of actual drug related semantic knowledge here in fact i find it rather offensive and contraproductive to the strife of making current drug laws less politically orientedwatch requiem for a dream if what youre looking for is an amazing touching film about drugs,negative
the filmmakers neglected to connect the dots that is the sequence of events and choices that led from charlie wilson and the anti soviet mujaheddin to al qaeda and osama bin laden and eventually to the filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back story why were the soviets in afghanistan but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for islamicist extremists in afghanistan in the name of rabid anti communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today terrorist networks a prolonged ground war in afghanistan etc because these consequences are not spelled out the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to mr wilson hey check out his latest projects on the internet instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the west as a whole,negative
i have to say that the events of didnt hit me until i saw this documentary it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers i was sick of hearing about it when this was aired on tv a year and a day later i was bawling my eyes out it was the first time i had cried since the attack i highly recommend this documentary i am watching it now on tv years later and i am still crying over the tragedies the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing it was an accident and look where it got them these two brothers make me want to have been there to help,positive
years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus i decided to purchase and watch it once and for allboy what a terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingmind you the version on the dvd is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut scenes from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this storyone only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a striptease in the act the ending birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane is another wink at sound of musicthe whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence im like what happened herethe comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingthe whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like shes on valium but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision as much as i like julie shes no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as cloying and cutehow bad is darling lili even after years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release,negative
someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date i have since discredited everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie its just terrible without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes take my word for it the sex scenes are uninteresting at best jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning was the highlight of the film she does look good but its all downhill from there,negative

topical certainly entertainment probably but only on removal of any shred of the viewers common sense reality only in so much that it was made on this planethow thousands of people were supposed to have died as a result of a metre wall of water in a city liberally littered with buildings in excess of metres high is quite beyond me carlyles line to the effect of how could anyone survive that when the shot shows forests of buildings with several floors above the water is completely laughable further if someone commits themselves to an area under water where one cylinder of air is not enough ie they are going to die why not use the simple expedient of taking more than one cylinder clearly the writer thinks that people in stressful situations cannot count beyond one one cylinder one floorrather than watching this tripe you would be more informed and entertained by throwing the dvd away and reading the pricing information on the cellophane outer wrapperpitiful truly pitiful and a terrible waste of the on screen talentas for the sexist propaganda suggesting that only women can see through the problems to illuminate the solutions to be effected by the expendable men yet more pc tosh small wonder that first blood delta force navy seals and other such movies of little or no merit will always have a following while this blatantly politically motivated bilge is peddled,negative
a gave it a instead of a awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork but that wasnt enough to save itthe sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies nothing new there i can see there were some hat tips to other old classic movies ok no problem with thatbut a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleepthe story line and the script of this movie was awful the characters two dimensional slow moving some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring i couldnt recommend it,negative
this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen me and my husband own over dvds most of which are sci fi and horror b movies that arent top quality but still entertaining dracula had absolutely no redeeming qualities at all the writing was horrific and the acting was even worse it took us a tries to get through the entire movie because we could only tolerate it in minute intervals we thought surely it must get betterwe were wrong i would rather watch a corpse being embalmed than to have to sit through that again when it ended me and my husband just looked at each other like uhis that it the ending seemed like there was supposed to be more but they ran over their apparent budget and were like oh crapwe are brokeend it nowquickroll credits,negative

what was there about that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films well whatever it was the magic may also be found in this columbia picture its a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show maltins movie book does not contain it in nearly every department amazing mr williams is a jewelits the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended as the wedding bells are about to ring he gets called to the scene of a murder the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force there are a lot of laughs in the processmelvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilariousthe film goes on a bit too long but who cares the screwball comedies are always able to entertain and this film belongs right in there with the best,positive
after viewing this film i felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration selma blair is a fabulous currently underrated actress and max beesley was rather charming in kill me later the story while not exactly original certainly showed some promise none of that mattered thoughat alli dont know what her deal is but director dana lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director she slowed footage down sped footage up reversed footage used awkward camera angles used annoying color filters made a zillion quick cuts jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious modern soundtrack of blaring junk i cant remember the last time i saw such an incompetent job of directing a film her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of it is crammed down their throatsthere are a couple of good scenes in kill me later which show what could have and should have been unfortunately just when things would start to show promise ms lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again its a shame because blair and beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart,negative
after a long wait bedrooms and hallways made it to perth cinemas not a commercial one mind you and i thought it was fun honest and took a swipe at those tribal scream groups running around trying to find meaning in rocks and whats behind my eyes it is playing to full houses over here because it tells a story has terrific acting and says something about the human condition,positive
no movies have grabbed my attention like this one has you see i have wanted to watch this movie again for over twenty five years the one and only time i saw it was as a teen ager which may have been the year it was released what i do remember of the movie is that it touched those deep held emotions so profoundly that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch it again the intrigue this movie provides by the human element of father son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who watches it why this movie has not been brought out of storage and shown as often as many other movies of lesser depth i do not knowpostscript received copy of movie and after watching it again was delighted to see that my memory held true rating reflects movie content would like to watch this movie on dvd as seeing this production on a used vhs tape took away from the overall quality,positive
you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year well it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them as bizarre settings go its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office having said that this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one if it was royal mail most letters get this sort of treatment anyway i havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a mr wang some female priest of the church of latter day ive never heard of you and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing companydead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home writing to her absent father she only learns in adulthood that her letters havent been delivered for one reason or another so logically she gets a job at the dlo and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo slowly she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self contained world of the dead letters office to its kneesnothing against this film but i was reminded of the god awful heather graham film committed while watching this however this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again that aint difficult for a start this film is much more logical true the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel it is also well acted both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know theyll never find while other characters are peripheral at best part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed the other part is that when you consider australias draconian immigration policy ie if you dont speak english rack off such a story is unlikely to take place in reality the other characters sadly also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd ball stereotypesdespite that dead letter office is certainly something a little different it might not be to everyones taste but i liked it yes it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy duty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film there aint any major laughs theres no bullet time and the characters are usually one dimensional but its the story that counts here and while its not earth shattering in its magnificence its a pleasant enough way of passing the time its the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there,negative
like the characters in this show i too was a teen during the s the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist of being a suburban teenager in the s the s fashions cars home furnishings foods and fads are all very authentic in this showthe show boasts a very talented ensemble cast who all mesh together very well on camera i really like the unique psychedelic style film sequences no other show does camera tricks like this these cutting edge film sequences really help to convey the campy hipness that characterized the s eraoverall this is a very funny sitcom the one thing that bothers me about this show is its over reliance on cruel humor to generate laughs in this way i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right its tacky that the creators of that s show keep trying to imitate it i do recommend that s show mainly due to its nostalgia factor it could be an even better show though if the writers relied more on witty dialog rather than bawdy tasteless jokes and pranks,positive

hey its only tv sure its star trek the most beloved bla bla and this is a great one but its all relative what it boils down to is a guy in elf ears grooving with a swatch of pizza colored shag rugtheres a kind of third man noirishness to the tunnel hunt and its creepier than many episodes of what is after all one of the better tv shows the suspense is actually suspenseful the peril really feels perilous as a little kid i think i cried when spock told me that this hideous creature was as sad scared and horrified as the people it was eating this was one of my early lessons in empathy a lesson reinforced by the empath episode which was if less thrilling even more melancholywhat bothered me when i was five was that this thing which looks like meat and tomato barf somehow actually consists more or less of rock now that kind of choice might seem visionary a hippie designers idea of through the looking glass one universism but it might also just smack of the drug era,positive
following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood the plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology the event sequence complicates following following if you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks with the running time at minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralledbill is a lonely untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go what they do he is a bit too conspicuous however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed clean cut bloke named cobb cobb entangles bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters by the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly the film is an excellent first effort from the talented christoper nolan who would go on to make memento one of the most original movies of our time,positive

i dont know what the last reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment basically dudes are put in competitions at a club to pick up girls in different scenarios they mix up the scenarios for each show so it is not the same every time the panel of judges is not afraid to call people out or admit it when they recognize game they will break down what the guy did wrong and what they guy did right some contestants are weak some are strong but what happens is always entertaining if you are a guy that goes out you can relate ive seen weak game ive seen strong game and this show is for real no doubt,positive

terry gilliams and david peoples teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the s peoples proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time i especially love the idea one cant change the past its a nice counterpoint to so many time travelling movies which say otherwise biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness perfection and originalitythe story itself is engaging one man james cole played by bruce willis in a heart warming performance travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus thats wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground with the information hell collect scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface but because their time travelling technology isnt perfect he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things and from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists end of the millennium paranoia biological weapons the perception of reality and the definition of sanity with such a complex movie it was easy for gilliam and peoples to create a mess but instead twelve monkeys is a thought provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideasi watched this movie once around years ago it marked me a lot i remember still thinking about many days after wards for my young mind this seemed quite mind blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important ive re watched this movie a few days ago on dvd and its better than i remembered it brad pitt still steals all the scenes hes in playing jeffrey goines almost a prelude to his tyler durden character in fight club a rich kid with some anarchist non conformist ideas whos also crazy and according to cole perhaps responsible for the virus the scenes between jeffrey and cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie pitts eyes voice and quirky mannerisms convince you hes really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands pitts oscar nomination was well deserved surprising was also bruce willis performance his i didnt remember very well but its beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground and when he comes to the past youll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character peoples tried to imbue some darkness in him and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole didnt start as a crazy character but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world hes considered mad and convinced its all in his mind until he arrives at a point when he cant distinguish past from future reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when coles shrink dr kathryn railly finds undeniable proof hes really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed although perhaps a bit compressed for times sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport wrapping all the pieces together which will blow many minds awaythere are two great endings in this movie a twist in the sense of seen or fight club and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole whos just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole whos witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past cant be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help raillys character shares that fatalism the more she tries to help cole first dealing with his madness then helping him in his mission the more theyre sucked into tragedythe twist ends with a hopeful note though with the feeling coles mission hasnt been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained its not supposed to be art although its more artists than many artistic movies its an unpretentious movie where all elements from music to editing to costume design etc came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece,positive
the omega code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency there was a bit but precious little of good acting primarily by the two prophets and rostenberg who only appeared once and had no lines otherwise the acting was decidedly bad the plot line was rather weak and only partially based on already questionable biblical interpretation certainly not one of the years best,negative

this comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its temporarilyhigh user rating which i find frankly puzzling the reasons why i didnt like this title are following the directer must have had some doubts whether to make a jackie chan type of a flick or a dark oedipian tragedy as a result in terms of genre the film falls between two stools as the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel out each other rather than make a harmonious whole the characters motives and behaviors are incoherent and unconvincing psychological truth and logic are sadly missing absurd casting i dont blame the actors for it is a hard thing to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is scarce logic in the script however why is there an apparent age difference of about years between the leading two actors whose ages in the film cant differ by more than to me the film was poor entertainment primarily because of point if you cant find a character you could sympathize with it is hard to follow the story with interest when you finally learn the reason of what happened to the main protagonist it turns out to make no sense some films apart from being entertaining are also thought provoking having seen this film i began to wonder whether the thought the director tried to provoke was not that incestuous relationships could be perfectly wholesome and delightful i cannot put any other construction on the ending the film is rife with totally unnecessary violence violence in a film and elsewhere is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose purposes can be different and i dont want to enter into this broad subject let me just say i dont object to violence in such films as saving private ryan the passion of the christ or the pulp fiction in oldboy the scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic or aural what for i do not know personally i dont derive any satisfaction from watching teeth being extracted with a hammer or hear a man cut off his tongue with scissors and then see him choking on his own blood etc etc the film reminds me a little of japanese porno mangas in its fixation on incest and young asian girls panties urinating and the like it appears there is a minority who actually enjoy this kind of thing if youre one of them you might find this film enjoyablein short i do not recommend this film either as entertainment or food for thought where it isnt silly it is disgusting dont waste your time,negative
i have to admit i have always found it difficult to watch an antonioni film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one i ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions in the end i realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one the first part seems a lot more fragmentary which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow when it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are repaid in full the stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable is how the landscape is made into an overwhelming presence the silence and vastness of it the sense of sadness and freedom the way it fuses and contrasts with the two young characters the desert is dead but at the same time it feels less distant and alien than the urban scenes in the first part the dance between the airplane flying over and the girls car makes for a series of great shots the love scenes in the desert are simply beautiful it is hard to imagine this kind of approach from a film of our times there is of course something very stylish and studied about them but at the same time they manage to express a sense of natural spontaneous innocence that is very rare these days it all feels loose and unscripted thanks also to the understated acting but that is the result of a maniacal attention to detail and form which comes to its climax in the series of explosions at the end a really mesmerising spectacle it just leaves you in awei dont really care for some the usual objections boring well yes it is if you want all films to follow a classic plot development and be packed with action twists but then if all cinema was like that that would be truly dull and sad pretentious maybe but when that kind of ambitiousness is coupled with actual skills depth and style pretentious is a compliment the political criticisms make the least sense to me i dont see the point of approaching a film like this with ideological blinders or worse patriotic requirements it just defeats the purpose perhaps its true that like a previous commenter remarked antonioni viewed these young hippies and the politics of protests and riots with the police with the fascination of a foreigner but i think that adds something rather than detracting from the film its not true that hippies did not exist in italy at the time think of the protests like in france although they were obviously different from the american counterpart and in some ways even more militant but his interest in this film was not narrowly political the events seem more like a pretext for a film whose appeal has a universal timeless qualitya special mention for the fantastic soundtrack amongst other things this film along with easy rider is probably one of the main earliest precursors of the contemporary artsy music video as well as the concept of a film soundtrack that would stand on its own but unlike the former it uses music in a much more subtle way blending it with the landscape rather than the action if you want traditional narrative in a film then dont bother if you want to be stunned be patient and you wont regret it,positive
the plot of this boils down to ah nuld versus satan and what i remember most about the movie is a lot of explosions gunfire blood noise and lets not forget that flammable satanic urine the story is nonsensical utterly predictable and so full of holes i couldnt take a bit of it seriously stick to rosemarys baby or the exorcist if you want to see a really good devil movie andum well i cant think of any good action movies at the moment probably because theyre so far and few between so youre on your own in that category this flick does get a out of rating from me for its camp value and for a pretty good performance by gabriel byrne as that old debbil satan,negative
this movie could have been summed up in about minutes i dont know what everyone else was smoking calling this a beatiful film i feel that a couple hours of my life were stolen from me and i want them back i would put this in the category of a battlefield earth yes folks it is that bad you would do just as well to watch a two minute clip of this movie over and over it would have the same effect do not waste your time,negative
another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batmandead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts the attention to detail character and action is undeniably real although this is a limited resources production it puts to shame big budgeted star casted hyped productions other superhero related movies here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people finally a superman that actually looks super and looks like the real thing batman the way it should be without the flashy rubber casted ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that dont deliver i just wish that some sensible warner bros exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel i dont care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd i would never get tired of watching it just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this hope the bigwigs at marvel dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look no more batman robin fiasco or hulk daredevil etc learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldnt be any reason to reinvent the hero for the movie just to have it bomb in theaters mr collorawe need more directors like you,positive
when i watched this film the first time it was a taped copy and the title was is caged terror i still own the tape and i confess ive watched it more than once from beginning to end the film is extremely low budget and the dialogue is often unintentionally amusing i have gotten a few of my friends to watch this and weve had some great laughs from the terrible script the film concerns a couple remember this is like early s so they are just too hip man who go on a week end camping trip in what i believe was supposed to be upstate ny they have some hilarious dialogue after catching and eating a fish and the girl bemoans the death of the fish and that they ate it the guy comes back with something goofy about how they ate the fish and now it was a part of them and he goes and thats beautiful man heavy man really heavy lol anyway along come a couple of vietnam vets one of who plays the flute i believe at any rate they are musical fellows the guys are clearly attracted to the girl and when the couple prove unfriendly they end up terrorizing them during the night the guy ends up caged in a chicken coop and has to watch his girl friend being ravished by the two guys actually by the end of the night she seems to be pretty into it and when morning comes the guys leave and the girl and guy are free to leave supposedly the guy has learned a lesson about how to treat people and the girl has a smile on her face anyway i would recommend this film highly to anyone looking for a damn good laugh it never fails to amuse me anyway if i could find this on dvd and replace my old tape copy id actually buy it again its classic camp you gotta love this stuff,positive
many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie my movie will always be john carpenters the thing the main reason why this movie is a cult film is perhaps the splatter effects created mainly by genius rob bottin and that this is the movie that made kurt russell what he is today along with escape from ny in my opinion this is not a great film because of the effects it has to do with the story the atmosphere and of course the acting i have watched thousands and thousands of movies every day the last years but none has had the impact on me as this one not even the great das bootheres my suggestion to you who likes sci fi and horror movies place yourself in the good chair of your home be sure youre not interupted by anyone if you aint got a projector sit close to your tv and watch this miracle of a film let it absorbe you and youll see it my waybest view time late february between and in the evening,positive

mr bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit a massive budget a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant and mr bean is one of those characters who you just cant forget some of these episodes had me in stitches yes theyre not realistic at all and theyre all pretty stupid but to be honest realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness rowan atkinson and co always manage to cook up interesting new ideas and hilarious new gags remember when mr bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof mr bean is one of those things that never gets weak the movie wasnt as good as this but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor extras and little britain can be damned this is british comedy at its best and most original these escapades never get old,positive
when i first heard about this movie i noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the s i noticed the music was by elton john so i figured i had nothing to loose so i got it what a surprise the movie was awesome it was true love is all about the characters paul and michelle had no luxuries no money and sometimes no food yet they were still happy i recommended this film to all my friends but they all critized my tastes and even called me names becuase the movie featured two minors naked i think that only made the movie more realistic the cinematography was great and it only come to show the great abilities of director lewis gilbert,positive
deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn every single turn in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film and it often doesnt make any sense although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters but you cant catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much but still works and is worth watching,positive
in out in my opinion is a very hilarious movie i thought that cameron matt dillon was wrong to say that howard kevin kline was gay the part i liked most was howards bachelor party this was because they were cracking jokes about a lot of things including barbra streisand films i also thought that emily joan cusack looked very beautiful in her wedding dress and that howard looked good in his tuxedo my favorite quote of in out is is everybody gay is this the twilight zone that was absolutely hilarious the one character i couldnt stand was sonya shalom harlow this was because she was very conceited and snobby in conclusion i recommend this movie to all you kevin kline fans who have not seen it be prepared to laugh hard and have a good time when you see it,positive
theres something intriguing about disaster movies the simple primal premise can lead to several great stories granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but i can usually live with thatunfortunately flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub genre robert carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters he gives a barely decent performance as well joanne whalley is very uneven veteran actor tom courtenay he played in doctor zhivago for heavens sake is particularly bad i mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor what an embarrassing performance for that man the rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception jessalyn gilsig whom i thought might be there as a plot device eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance doesnt mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she caredthe script is really bad confusing and cliché some of the worse lines i have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the otheryouve seen this story a thousand times it employs every dramatic hook and tear jerkers youve seen in outbreak armageddon the poseidon movies original and remake and many othersthe direction is awful no sense of timing nothing inspired the shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor cgi the human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done the made for tv feel gives nausea some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter no problem lets show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possiblethe movie score is rather poor all over the place no timingthe ending is probably the worse i have seen in quite some time very much like they ran out of ideas scrap that you cant run out of something if you never had it in the first place must have ran out of budgetthis is a really amateur job i give it a for using london as a location which is a nice change for gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few cgi shots that were decent those of the water closing in on london and the gatesdo yourself a favor and check out day after tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one this includes older classics like the towering inferno,negative
the second half of steven soderberghs revolutionary bio on che guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to bolivia in order to maintain his saintly visage of che soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in cuba and the folly of his congo adventure this is the history of a failure he writes in the preface of his congo journal to concentrate fully on ches attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in bolivia it would turn out to be a disaster and guevaras final actwhat plagued the first chapter follows suit here as soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative guevara once again being played like james dean in east of eden by bernicio del toro the problem is guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness bolivian jungle unlike werner herzog in the magnificent aguirre the wrath of god soderbergh fails to utilize the jungles metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas he seems more concerned with keeping ches nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders there is one herzogian moment where che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall soderberghs mise en scene remains flat sloppy and uninteresting in both of his films soderbergh shows he is clearly a che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow he spends too much time building his monument to che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga especially fidel castro making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire one would think he was steeped in enough eisenstein and vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style,negative
as a long standing barbra fan any posting like this will be biased that aside this film ranks as a classic it has its flaws emphasized in other postings but gives a glimpse of a time late s that will never be there again and is fascinating to watch unfold on screenstreisand fought hard to make this movie her own i dont think she was ever satisfied but it gives her fans a new barbra for the time with live singing a young fresh appearance and some very heavy duty actingthe story is rough but exciting and holds your interest throughout the extended one frame finale is hard for most non barbra fans to sit through but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent,positive
this was a highly original decent movie and a brave move for all those involved i dont care if its not the most well put together movie of all time the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non formulaic and that i dont know what will happen next makes it a favorite of mine i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one rather than the same old formula for entertainment,positive
i watched this movie by chance get curious by the trailer on tv i like when i discover movies like this little tender stories about ordinary people even if the end is tragic the man in the moon has some funny moments especially in the first characterization of dani with her innocent and pure love affair with court its really a beautiful moving love story with high points the performance of reese witherspoon who maintained her promises in the world of cinema the beautiful cinematography by the old lion freddie francis and the fantastic score by james newton howard which is really the soul of the movie his themes which deserved an oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it seems they had transformed the screenplay in music,positive
im not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan an advice columnist who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brothers girlfriend its a story thats been told before but not like this there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be the cast is wonderful and even if carell is not my cup of tea he is quite good as the widower whos suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film worth a look see,positive
normally i dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me all they did was swear for the whole film and as someone else noted get cancer it was boring rambling and pretentious i wouldnt if i were you its also not that i dont like films which as most people who like it will claim observe life i love eat drink man woman and all that happens in that is that a load of taiwanese people lead their lives but i could relate to them i have never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this film and i used to work on a construction site so go figure having said that william h macy made me grin once avoid unless you enjoy tedium,negative
i always wanted to see electra glide in blue for a very long time ive always been intrigued by the title the star and the desert but for some now pretty clear reason this film is never shown on tv or ive happen to miss it if its ever shown well after watching the dvd i now know why the movie is rarely shown its because its not that good in fact id say its pretty much of a messelectra glide in blue was made by a first time director and it shows the film is mainly a series of vignettes with absolutely nothing holding it together more like a collection of short movies haphazardly strung together the movie can be boiled down to this intro murder cop and girlfriend together intro credits cops going to work crazy guy tells story cop finds dead body cop and chief and girlfriend at bar chase scene etc the scenes just dont flow together theyre very distinctively independent from each other and because of this the characterization is weak borderline amateurish the scene at the bar with the girlfriend the scene at the farm with the hippies the scene with big john and the chief yelling at each other were cringe worthy i almost stopped the film during those awful momentsthe film makers lack of experience is in evidence throughout the film the style like the s is all over the map the intro credit scene makes the movie look like a commercial for law enforcement then it tries to be a buddy film big john and zipper then a murder mystery then a melodramatic love story etc a film doesnt have to have one particular style in order to be successful but im afraid the style in electra glide in blue was confused you can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with itthe film is not a complete disaster while the content of electra glide in blue is almost amateurish the look of it is extremely and deceptively professional the cinematography is stunning every frame is worthy of an exhibition at an art gallery or because the first and last time director was involved in the music business worthy of an album cover the beautiful look of the film gives more credence to the finish product than it really deserves and thanks to robert blakes acting of a really badly written character the film maintains a certain level of realism even though nothing else makes much sense whats remarkable about the look and composition of the film is that its been copied and duplicated a million times over the intro credits reminded me of something like top gun which was made years later scenes of johnny dressing up with his clothes on the bed reminded me of american gigolo strangely enough electra glide in blue has a very contemporary feel to it due to the stunning visuals even if the story and the philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdatedso electra glide in blue is on one hand a remarkably underrated and overlooked film because it obviously influenced a lot of future filmmakers out there when it comes to the look and composition very few films can claim to have achieved this and legendary cinematographer conrad hall should take full credit but on the other hand egib is also deservedly forgotten because the poor characters confusing story and muddled direction none of which are worth of remembering,negative
this film could have been a decent re make and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried assembling talented actors together with a successful experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film but ms englishs experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this filmi am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe a laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com i think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms englishs talents didnt translate i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesnt recreate her stereo typed role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such a great talent and yet such a poor performance i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the s doesnt translate to the s and no one helped ms english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance i think it could have been good but it was notits so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyones time money this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate a few movie execs are having a meeting the caption reads lets remake a classic with worse everything,negative
this movie should go down as one of the funniest movies in history its cousins a mighty wind spinal tap and waiting for guffman are terrific in their own right but best in show takes the cake a movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively its the intricacies of the characters that make it so good after watching the movie about times i have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film there is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film if you watch this movie and dont find it as funny as i am billing it as watch it again the first time i saw it i thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious it is a film that grows on you defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently characters hamilton and meg swan a if you get the dvd check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head and to find out that they really didnt go by a script and sort of made it up as they went gerry and cookie guggleman a cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the cookie character gerry eugene levy delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half stefan vanderhoof and scott donalan a find me a funnier character than scott donalan i dare you he will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didnt seem forced at any point stefan micheal mckean was very good as well and they interplay here and a brief appearance with the gugglemans goes to show why he is always in these films a great actor with razor like wit harlan pepper b i dont want it to seem like he isnt funny he sure is but being the only solo act he cant be quite as funny as the others above he does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for himthe rest are all great as well there is no weak character see this film at least twice buy it you will not regret it,positive

i carefully checked if theres another movie named as this one and there isnt but i really dont think we all saw the same movie theres no way how can you vote more than for this movie the idea of this movie lets say its acceptable oh and the acting of dan gordon chris is quite good but those are the only two things acceptable in this project the others are awful its a very delicate word to describe the acting of the other actors the directing the so said special effects even the way that the crew was filming i dont even like the way that the camera operators were moving to record the scenes this may be the most miserable film ive ever seen i really dont remember a movie lower than this one maybe there is but i dont think so ehh whats done its done thats the movie and theres too late for anyone to change anything ive voted but my realistic vote starts with a minus in front,negative
i have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed and in my opinion this movie lacks heart i frankly didnt care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie there was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didnt because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it i have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough but i felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and i was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point honestly while i didnt feel like tearing my hair out during the movie i did remorse the lost time on the sad little filmi have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly i didnt,negative
this is one of the oddest movies i have watched in a long while usually if they are this strange i bail out early and rarely regret it luckily i held on for this one while i cant say that this is a great movie it isnt i can say that watching it is rather like a good acid trip only a few really awful moments and the rest filled with did i really just see that wonderment lots of laugh out loud moments a great cast of characters with meredith eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter in law with an attitude keep an open mind,positive
im guessing that we all no matter if we are fans of cars luv the sound of a dodge challenger as it growls along the road the noise a chevy make as it screams with ecstasy when it tears round a corner and most of all the blast of sound as a classic vehicle bursts into flames as it explodes im not the biggest car enthusiast by any stretch of the imagination but any of the above really does rev my engine theres no denying the importance of transport on cinema it has even been said that the invention of the train was one of the biggest influences on early cinema looking out a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of being transported to a different time space but the car remains the most popular and most luved its even got its own genre the carsploitation genre a genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars in effect its just porn car porn and im not talking about that rather nasty documentary on channel in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars whatever floats yourcar i guess moving on whilst running on empty isnt quite as pornographic as vanishing point richard c sarafian for instance with its close ups of the car in motion all its bumps and curves this doesnt mean that the car isnt the main focus of this film in fact the cars themselves become characters more on that later theyre objectified and fetishised as much as the women in fact maybe even more and holy holy are these cars something every car in this film besides the ones in the background are simply beautiful works of art theres no question about itas i was saying these incredible cars are in a way given characters themselves you actually start sympathising with the car spoiler most notably during the scene in which the car is being wrecked and burnt spoiler over this has become almost a convention of the carsploitation genre the evil plymouth fury from christine john carpenter satans custom lincoln mark iii in the car elliot silverstein the nifty little mini coopers from the italian job peter collinson to the friendly volkswagen beetle in the love bug robert stevenson and of course each car from death race paul bartel and even wacky races all of which had their own character ironically however this emphasis on the car often over takes the human characters and this is certainly the case with running on empty in which only one human character the blind character who drives his car with his hearing rather than sight has any sort of dimension the rest are very much stock characters these are all your stereotypical australian s teenagers big hair annoying accents and none of whom would look out of place in neighbours especially the kylie minouge look a like but who gives a damn its all about the cars racing and crashing thats it if you dont like that you really are watching the wrong genrethe car scenes are certainly the selling point of this film and the best thing its got going for it they are fast very fast and were not talking about the rather annoying technique some films seem to use where they record the car speeding at around mph and then speed it up oooh no not with this film you dont these cars are zooming along at top speeds in real time no fancy editing tricks here so weve got speed check what about crashes check check check whilst there isnt cars crashing everywhere a la the incredibly blues brothers john landis when cars do crash in this film they certainly crash it would seem that they use gunpowder or something similar to build the cars as one little hit and kaboom theyre up in flames it kind of reminded me of thriller a cruel picture bo arne vibenius in that sensebetween these simply awesome scenes especially the very start and the very end there are quite a few scenes which slow everything done and in my opinion fail to add very much to the film note more exploding cars needed however there are a couple of exceptions here which are great scenes spoiler especially the attempted rape sceneso all in all this is a mans film a boys film full of cars vroom vroom vrooming around the outback and a couple of tits thrown in for good measure too id recommend this little film to anyone even if they are keen cyclists its a great film which you can just switch your brain off sit back in your leather chair and put on full volume ill give it luvs out of luvs bruuuuum ps amazon are selling this for just over its a real bargain although the dvd lacks any special features whatsoever,positive

on one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again on a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land i thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when im not out here alone for any length of time i feel unrootedi considered andy goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists im familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations but to see his work in motion captured perfectly through riedelsheimers lens was a revelation unfrozen in time goldsworthys creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashingand thats precisely what hes all about time the process of creation and destruction of emergence and disappearing of coming out of the void and becoming the universe and back again theres a shamanic quality about him verging on madness you get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didnt do it he would whither and perishluckily for us goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person,positive
as an ancient movie fan i had heard much about the controversial movie caligula assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others i decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film i sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch the beginning quotation from the new testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in mewhy to entail a sentence from the gospel by mark in the movie about pagan rome but the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple caligula and drusilla running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental the music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense yet the negative feelings raised in me quite soon particularly at the death of tiberius the cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated however it was not that horrific to the middle during the second half of the film i felt as if i watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn in the end i said to myself this is one of the movies that one may really hate i am aware that a movie may be controversial but i had never expected that caligula would go that far in removing all limits of taste i hate this film due to many reasons but particularly onecaligula does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic which it claims to be but bob guccione the director and the founder of penthouse pornographic magazine aims at combining film art with porn that is i think the most serious matter the film may be accused of movie is an art that should be reigned by taste by message by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste caligula shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked decadent manner some scenes are so disgusting that i dont think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them some say that the rome under caligulas reign was so brutal yes it is true corruption bloomed at that time various sexual deviances were preferable to roman citizens yet i do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic i believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies huge historical mistakes the screenplay by gore vidal is notorious for inaccuracies it is noticeable for instance with the figure of proculus donato placido a historic roman senator yet the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes moreover livia was not proculus wife raped by caesar on her wedding what lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence another example of historical travesty is the figure of caesonia portrayed by helen mirren she is presented as caligulas wife together with drusilla his sister in fact caligula married caesonia long after the death of his sister the sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases i also hated the moment with the killing machine a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts technical aspect and cast from the technical point of view the film is nothing special the cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding yet the only strong point of the movie are the performances particularly the one by malcolm mcdowall as caligula he does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor mcdowall raises the value of the film if everything bothers you in caligula you may at least admire his performance i also fancied helen mirren as caesonia and teresa ann savoy as drusilla yet the film is based on a gossip by suetonius that caligula made love to his sister sir john gielgud as nerva and peter otoole as old tiberius are also memorable otoole does his finest piece of acting in the capri grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor yes i admit that the only thing i like about caligula are the performances therefore i dont rate the movie lame continuity the historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity let us analyze just the beginning caligula comes to capri grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old tiberius then after about minutes the action moves to rome where a black bird near drusilla and caligulas bed constitutes a bad omen and immediately the characters are again in capri where nerva john gielgud is dying all in all i dont recommend to see caligula to anyone if you want to know the story read robert graves gorgeous novel i claudius and claudius the god or watch herbert wises mini series with the magnificent performance by derek jacobi caligula is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art it is in its most part a porn movie that should never be called an epicthere are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen peoples taste of beautythere are movies that are average entertainment yet they have something to offerthere are movies that show extreme violence yet they still convey some moralthere are however movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm peoples mindscaligula unfortunately belongs to the latest group,negative

the question is can a movie this entertaining really be considered a bad movie my husband and i picked this up at a used video store for cents simply because of the title and the fact that the box had the words vestron pictures on it vestron has been highly regarded as a mark of quality ever since i first acquired the legendary films suburbia and class of we were not expecting a movie as full of win as this one was your basic plot as is follows grange this goombaesque thug from planet earth robs the bank of the moon and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet i dont even remember the planets name to mine for bauxite and other minerals the governor of said colony and the owner of the mine are exploiting the prisoners for labor walker a bounty hunter apparently one of only three on the whole planet reminds the prisoners that there is no escape because theres only one shuttle out of the whole planet and theyd have him to deal with then theres the nameless colonel a retired bounty hunter who suffers from a haunting reoccurring nightmare much of the movie centers around futuristic car chases dunebuggies with plywood slapped to the sides with explosions galore the planet itself looks suspiciously like hemet ca or one of those other dusty inland empire outposts but what makes the movie truly shine is a surprisingly awesome soundtrack featuring several la punk bands of the mid s i seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever pressed to vinyl but its definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack i cant even remember the names of the bands theyre listed in the credits other than exploding white mice because that was the only one id heard of before i saw this movie but im definitely looking into thembasically the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and would be best enjoyed with a pack of beer and a few of your closest friends,positive
michael polishs hypnotic northfork is a film that will stay in ones memory for quite a long time this exquisitely crafted movie that michael and mark polish wrote is visually one of the best things that came out last year from the world of independent films the movie is splendidly photographed by m david mullen with a haunting score by stuart matthewmanif you havent seen the film perhaps you should stop reading herethe idea to set the film in montana was a great coup for the polish brothers never has the majestic views of the country and mountains been so vividly captured as in northfork we dont need any color the beauty is in the dark tones of the film that enhances the story of the desolation in this remote outpostat the center of the story is irwin the sick child under the care of the mysterious father harlan this boy is seen in his bed where the kind priest is administering the medicine for his body but is he really there at all we watch him interacting with the odd group that we first encounter around the cemetery there are two freshly open graves will one of them be for irwin at the same time another plot line plays parallel to this first theme we see the six men in black that have come to the area in order to remove from the area as many people as they can this will be the bed for the man made lake that will be created their reward is one acre and a half of lake front property if they move a certain amount of peoplethe third story line centers on the mystical group composed by flower hercules cup of tea cod and happy they are following a possibility of a link to an angel that has been injured in this area when irwin meets them at the cemetery he offers to help only if they take him away at least a thousand miles from here we watch as the quartet examine the feathers the boy has placed among the pages of his bible could irwin be that angel the closing sequence show us all parties leaving northfork in different directions the men in black riding their automobiles perhaps going home to enjoy the newly acquired properties given to them as a reward the mystical group is seen boarding a plane and taking off for a higher place we also realize that the child in father harlan in spite of the medicines and the care he received from the saintly figure has diedmichael polish got one of the best ensemble acting from all the principals nick nolte as father harlan turns a low key performance in his portrayal of this kind man james woods as walter one of the men working for the developer does a fine job the biggest surprise is duel farmer who makes an excellent impression as irwin this child actor with the right guidance shows great promisethe mystical group is brilliantly acted by daryl hannah robin sachs ben foster and anthony edwards the man with the funny spectacles peter coyote mark polish ben foster and the rest of the cast are flawless under mr polish directionthe beauty of the film relies in its simplicity mr polishs vision will haunt ones memory the images of montana as perhaps an unreal landscape is one of the best things in american films in quite a while,positive
in i saw an outstanding musical at the wintergarden in new york city where angela lansbury lite the stage as mame but did hollywood give her the lead no lucille ball great as lucy was given the role she killed the film what a mistake there was no chemistry as there was on the stage bea arthur and angela what a twosome when they sang it is too bad a producer does not put these two together even today,negative
this almost documentary look at an enterprising boy who lives in the body shop area outside of new york is real all the way real lighting real sound less editing in the whole movie than in minute of most movies and while there is very little script there is a story shot in primary colors almost all red white blue and yellow we get a real sense of the life of a boy who is making something from nothing he has a place to live that he makes his own has a good job and is trying to bring his sister into his little universe the people in the chop shop area also give us a look at this culture which i didnt know about they mostly seem decent and pay ale what seems like daily seeming truly concerned about his well being the actor i think playing ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine this reminded me what a true small movie can accomplish it shows what kids are capable of even without much support and love definitely recommend,positive
i saw most of the episodes of rmftm as a teenager on cliffhanger theater running after midnight on a local station some years ago and then again when mystery science theatre riffed on it in the early s time has not been kind to it i can certainly make allowances for the special effects which were quite impressive for a low budget s serial imo commando codys flying scenes were better than george reeves supermans in his tv show and i can also make allowances for the ahem acting and fight choreography except for the guy who plays the ruler of the moon men he is incredibly miscast he looks and acts like the fellow who comes to fix your plumbing not the despotic ruler of an alien race even the corny dialog works all right everyone rattles off their lines like strings of firecrackers with no wasted time or pauses for things like thought or introspection since everyone does this the viewer finds it immersive after awhile and even to my modern sensibilities it doesnt bother much what really irritates me is the writing and the plotting im not talking about the sunny weather on the moon or baking soda powered rocket ships or a flying suit that has controls labeled up down and fast slow im not even bothered by the cheesiness of the resolutions to the cliffhangers that end each chapter im talking about the fact that our supposed heroes are dumber than fence posts and have no cumulative memory and by the fact that although that the dialog clips along like an express train the plot goes through the same motions again and again dig it commando cody and his pal are the spearhead of a top secret hi tech science lab charged with protecting earth or at least the usa against an insidious alien invasion but his office has no guards or security checkpoints they dont even have locks on the front doors so the bad guys walk right in and beat the crap out of the cody and his staff not once perhaps understandable but several times they even kidnap his female assistant on the second try and they never get any smarter to further prove my point allow me to point out the way that cody jumps in his flying suit and flies around getting into trouble and never actually seems to succeed in catching anyone he does this over and over and over cody also flies his ship to the moon the woman assistant comes along to cook stays for about seconds and immediately turns around and comes back cody captures one of the atomic ray gunsand immediately loses it again to the bad guys because he couldnt be bothered to lock it up and so onand you would think that if codys efforts were so vital to saving the usa from the moon men that he might ask for a few soldiers with carbines a few helicopters and a tank or two to back him up instead of just working with the local police all the time this was supposed to be a military operation but they act like its another episode of gangbusters its all rather hard to stomach i appreciate that the creators were severely limited in the scope of their story by budget and time constraintsand i appreciate that cody is actually a reasonably tough hombre even though he loses half of his fistfights but i just cant help yelling door lock the doooor when the gangsters simply walk into his lab or try to blow up the ship and there are no security measures at the landing site in placenot even a fence still its ok of the three republic serials ive watched phantom creeps had a better plot and undersea kingdom had more atmosphere hah and a better hero than radar men but its an ok time waster btwwhy radar men they didnt use radar they used atomic ray guns shouldnt the title have been atomic ray gun men from the moon,negative
based on the manga comic of well known artist masamune shirow this animated feature was a slight disappointment to methe story is good but the animation is merely ok while it could should have been mindblowing the movie is imo adequate but seems somehow flat uninspired if you know what i mean a wasted opportunity if you consider that another work by shirow ghost in the shell is considered a classic in many respects it set new standards for japanese animation and spawned among other things a brilliant series called gits stand alone complexi consider this worth a rental unless youre a fan of shirow and want it all do check out the original manga which comes highly recommended,positive
half past dead starring steven seagal in the main role was a major b hit half past dead is just a direct to video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something its less entertaining than the first one in all aspects but its although worthy a look if you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session if you also like to watch former wwe stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or notkurupt did a good job bill goldberg was below the average i think he isnt made to the job kurupt is a good comedian i say the rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alrighttechnical details well a production made by sony cant be great cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable whatever just watch it if you want if you watch you wont lose anything but if you dont well you wont lose either,negative
i enjoyed every moment of this movie even though i knew they could never really be together with the life expectancy of a bomber pilot being only six weeks it made me feel for all of those women and men back in the s who must have lived this story,positive
the powerhouse cast pulls the crowd in the theatre despite the ominous title jake gyllenhaal guested on conan obrien to promote the movie and explained that rendition was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture since extraordinary rendition allowed the governments intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for informationgyllenhaal plays rookie cia analyst douglas freeman note the irony who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the us omar metwally plays the suspected terrorist anwar el ibrahimi egyptian national and green card carrying hubby of american isabella fields el ibrahimi reese witherspoon isabella and her son wait for anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the planes passenger manifest she seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the head of intelligence corrine whitman meryl streep is behind it all rendition is directed by hollywood newbie gavin hood who is set to do x men origins wolverine and begs the question of whether such extraordinary rendition is exercised in real life the movie was released locally in the wake of the glorietta explosion bombing mishap and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza so that must have sent chills up every moviegoers spine seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign aajala ayala on the upper right hand of the screen plus the effect of silence and slow moving images magnified the impact of the scenes real life coincidence there are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make daily we all have choices we can exercise at will and we often do not always want to see how these affect others who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance what the greater good is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source now thats a utopia worth building,positive
this was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a childrens comic i gave it out of for its attention to detail because for the most part it had a s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was goodthis was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies no interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people in fact i know just as much now about the programme as i did before i watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book as for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasnt common knowledge well that never happened,negative
i remember this film exhibit in barcelona spain in for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i cant offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality that is bergman resnais malle buñuel and the projected man few people saw it luckly people no doubt and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter nichols science fiction encyclopidie or about the author of the original novel very indicative i remember of it after all this years a no story a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact and no more it seems that in some countries the running time is mm and in anothers min well it means only a little more of pain,negative
really its a dreadful cheat of a film its minute running time is very well padded with stock footage the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes the plot exposition is very poorly rendered they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors please dont askthe plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth its a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by thenwhat saves this film somewhat uniquely is the stock footage ive never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see theres a brief interception by a pilot flying in alternate shots an f scorpion and an f first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f sabre jets or canadian built cf s and even a pair of cf clunksthen for some reason there are b s b s and even bs are seen taking off more paddingthese canadian jets are moving at miles an hour i dont think so since one of them appears to be a ww era gloster meteor the rest f s the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f f with a flight of early straight wing f s attacking in formationtheres a strange tandem cockpit version of the f that doesnt seem to be the t training type but some sort of interim all weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose these are scrambled in a snowstorman angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about meters it launches f u crusaders f f tigers a vigilantes and a skywarriors the air force scrambles f s and f s and more f s then youve ever seen in your life as well as f super sabres and f delta daggersthe f s press their attack with sooooo much padding the f s unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo the f s fire an f lets loose a falcon even some f s f s with mid wing rocket pods let loose there is a very strange shot of a late model f prototype with a straight wing early model f above it in a turn obviously a manufacturers republic aviation advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f thunderjet how it strayed into here is anybodies guessthere is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york citys times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early s i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind boggling and there is a nice tr to be seen also canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the backgroundas far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture and she most definitely is flipping someone off could it be r as in robert loggia the director who dies before this film was released her career as this was her last creditits like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift,negative
the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest the intriguing plot such as it is seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along a would be female vampire scantily clad as promised by the title is held in captivity inside a remote chteau and emerges only to feast on the blood of willing victims who are apparently members of a suicide club as if unsure where all of this would lead him the writer director ultimately has the human villain actually the blank faced heros kinky father ludicrously revealed as a mutant from the future the languorous pace and dream like atmosphere the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl are of course typical of both the film maker ditto the seashore setting at the anticlimax and the euro cult style as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display personally the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson who appeared in six latter day luis bunuel films crop up bemusedly through it from time to time,negative

if you find the first minutes of this film to be so slow that you wonder why youre watching it dont give up also hearing the danish language is a bit new to most north americans who dont see and hear a lot of danish films anyway as the film progressed it got better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his her patiencebeing a fan of the movie out of africa this film piqued my interest because its based on a short novel by isak dinesen karen blixen the major character in that filmthe meal babettes feast was amazing im no chef but i was impressed how one interprets the story too varies i suppose depending on how much you read into this and where you stand religion wise if the latter how you look at the definition of legalism can affect how you interpret this storyin any case its a fine film but dont watch this if youre dieting,positive

all through his career hitchcock did great films this was not one of thema man knows too much his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence and in the denouement all is resolved to the accompaniment of gunfire and rooftop dramaanyone who has seen s fritz lang films m comes to mind will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which subverts any sense of menace darkness and depravity that hitchcock might have been seeking to instilwhat it is worth watching out for however is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood transfusion the camerawork is lively the cuts are interesting and the way that everything combines to a climax is masterly here you can see the future master hitchcock effortlessly orchestrate all the resources to impressive and memorable effect when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it,negative
greetingsi never thought i would see the day when i would be so disgusted by a movie that it would be a burden to finish it i was always a fan of horror movies bc and cs included but in this case its hard to describe how a movie could fail to qualify for any letters in that scalethe movie is centered on a poorly developed back story a mix of folklore with an after taste and to top it up the performance of the actors is questionable horror b movies usually fall in two categories a gem that was under looked and under funded so bad its funny laugh or your money back well this movie falls in between i wasnt scare didnt laugh so i guess if you really need to see it you could but i recommend you dont,negative
i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow which i enjoyed however this dud seemed to last forever its one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg while not being kid appropriate the jokes arent just low brow or ft jokes theyre crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg ratingtoo badit might have made a bigger splash as an r rated film if the funny was left in overstatement probably i do not recommend this movie it is a full on waste of timeand im a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot at minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding downand boy were we ready for it to the ending is quaint but doesnt salvage the rest of this quagmire tourist trap of a rental star glad i saw it as a freebiewould have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe,negative
do not expect a classic military comedy which claims to make fun of the military while only enhancing a militaristic outlook instead it deconstructs the elements that make the military such a murderous machine kind of east german version of buffalo soldiersnva works on a meta level that it sympathizes with its heroes attempts to escape from army drill any which way they can its not about loud laughs but about long lasting smiles utopian of course in one scene you will be shown the harsh reality but very thoughtfuljust to fill the required lines do not go into that movie if you have been an army officer and liked your job,positive
this film gets off to a bad start an incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly done truly amazing spaceship crash then things go downhill again as you realize that the survivors are all a bad actors apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath and b almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster fodder hell half of them dont even speak english preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all you feel as if you were watching deep blue sea meets silence of the lambs minus the good bits and unfortunately the entire thing tries to hard to be crashed on a desert planet with hannibal lecter during the daylight scenes vin diesel is a great actor but he is no anthony hopkins and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper cool psycho there is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or sobut then things take a turn i cant exactly pinpoint the moment but soon the movie gets a lot better it also feels less chopped the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative and vin diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show stealer by the time the first monsters appear the film is actually quite enjoyable by the time night falls it is great thrilling horrifying and exciting and even the character development of most main characters is well done if you can just sit through the poor bits at the start youre in for some great entertainment besides the visuals are eye candy and i honestly admit i love the colour and the tone of this movie could have been if only,positive
this film has a really weird mixture of genres toilet humour and action in one it doesnt really pull it off it should have stuck to one genre the best thing i can say about the movie is that the dog in it is cutethe most disturbing sequence is in the middle of the film when moses sandler and carter wayans decide to stop off at a hunting lodge motel im not quite sure what the point of this sequence is it just seems gratuitous in the extreme the proprietor of the hunting lodge charlie is a very nerdy looking guy for some reason moses starts a conversation with charlie about porno jacking off homosexual sex sex in a threesome charlies photo of his wife appears to be charlie dressed in drag there is no reason for this really juvenile dialogue and scene anyway the whole scene seems to be directed to the moment when a naked moses ends up with carters gun up his butt and charlie sees them through the window it all reeks of school boy humour about homosexuality horrified and titillated all at the same time which i dont find funny at alli have a friend who is always raving about adam sandler movies this is the first one ive seen after this im not sure i want to see any morebtw this is my husbands account hes seen happy gilmore and he tells me its quite good maybe i should give sandler just one more chancecountess skogg,negative
im a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising aka not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover please dont tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplate afraid im another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism great idea shame about the execution and it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead all apparently thinking that they were appearing in a series of very different films i wish that aka had been audacious innovative or just simply interesting sadly it was like watching an unintentionally hysterical home video with arty aspirations a missed opportunity,negative
like most musicals of the era one must check reality at the door broadway melody of is not remotely believable nor plausible but kind of fun in its strange way this movie is really just an excuse to execute the talents of the stars some scenes just happen as if they were in a review not a plot driven moviejudy garland shines and its a pity she has so little to do unless much was left on the cutting room floorone of the most inane happenings are the way eleanor powell get a lead role in a broadway show and robert taylor says its going to be work work work from dawn til dusk several scenes go by and theres no work no rehearsalsnothing she needs money to win a horse in an auction she has no money isnt she getting paid while she rehearses taylor has to borrow money to help hes supposed to be a big time producer he has no money anyway thats just two elements in this strange storythe musical numbers are quite wonderful which saves this from being a total loss broadway melody of is much better as is broadway melody of,negative
ive seen a few of mr boormans movies and didnt like much of them not that they are bad movies quite the contrary are good movies but not content i personally found entertaining however i think where the heart is although made to cater to the less than art savvy american audience is masterful as satire and as social commentary of the times it was made in ive had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time i loan it out to someone i know could appreciate its artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol the last time took years to replace it since it was out of print for vhs sales has never been made as a dvd that i know of and had to wait till one of the premium cable channels ran it before i could tape it againmy favorite aspect after the nail on the head social commentary is the paintings by timna woollard ive searched for years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them i have a room in my house that i dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video aquarium or as a documentary of her work if anyone does know of where i can acquire any sort of copy of timnas work or where her studio is in england please do not hesitate to contact me via email,positive
i bought this video on a throw out table at the video store expecting a good cast in what was touted as an award winning brit sex comedy i guess i should have read the finer print i rarely write a panning review but here goesthese actors in gay roles really play games with your memories of a lot of far more worthy films this comedy was a very cruel joke at the expense of the actors the theatre going public and of all the nice films that have contributed to their reputationsi repeat is the joke about trashing the actors other highly respectable on screen personae with this scurrilously trashy flick can the reference to the austen classics pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility be anything else how much of a political statement was it to produce this melodrama using these stars are we meant to simply take it as a lay down misere that all actors are gay and thus letting their on screen roleplay affect our lifestyles is accepting their private homosexual dealings in our faces too im sorry but i dont think so i say no to this one,negative
growing up in the late s and s i could not help but become a fan of science fiction with americas space program in top gear sci fi books movies tv shows and comic books fueled my imagination and opened my mind to the possibilities that exist in the universe farscape is so unlike any other sci fi show yet it has all the ingredients that made shows like star trek battlestar gallatica x files and deep space nine personal favorites one of the criticisms of farscape is that the casual viewer cant just jump in and watch one episode and understand what is going on there have been other very successful shows that used multiple episode story arcs and complicated characters this for me is one of the charms of the show i dont need or want to have the story all tied up neatly at the end of every episode like the various incarnations of star trek have done all in all farscape has wonderful and funny characters and a running storyline that says that although humans may be the least evolved or advanced intelligent species in the universe they still have unique qualities and abilitiesunfortunately the shortsighted people at the sci fi channel have canceled farscapes th season they have stated that the cancellation was based on sagging ratings yet just a few years ago it was their top rated original series and a critical favorite its a shame that all of the artists who help create this show will be unable to continue their labor of love because of the fiscal problems of the very channel company that made it all possible in the first placehey dont take my word for it watch the show watch the re runs and make up your own mind help save farscape,positive
part ii or formerly known as guerilla is also a great achievement but not quite as entertaining as part i because this is where we begin to witness what might have caused the fall and death of che guevara once again im impressed by the cause and effect that both parts have in their interconnecting stories were reminded again and again that the lead character che guevara is an argentine some of the men in fidels army chose not to take orders from a foreigner and now that che has chosen to leave the comfort of victory to continue the revolutionary in bolivia he doesnt get much respect from his new army and the natives either only because hes a foreigneras far as technical goes i think part ii wouldve been more helpful if before everything else right after the display of the map it would show some highlights from the previous installment just to refresh memory about his characters and what hes set himself on doing to make the audience understand why his methods was successful in cuba but they dont work in bolivia it is clear now in this segment that che is not as charismatic as fidel castro in bolivia hes dealing with a bunch of soldiers whose hearts are not fully in it its said that the ingredient for revolutionary is love well they dont give a damn that much about their country so its a tough sell its excruciatingly painful and difficult for che to get the others to buy into his visioni like one particular scene that illustrates ches deteriorating condition a scene in which his horse would not go no matter how badly che tries to direct it and then his temper took the better of him and for a moment there he forgets hes a doctor and he becomes this desperate soldier whos stabs his own horse his army is like a horse that doesnt want to be led but at the same time the film drags it relies on small cameos from familiar faces that youll recognize just for the sake of brief entertainment and for the most part you get pounded left and right by one obstacle after another but maybe that is the intention of part ii if so then it definitely works standing ovation to the cinematography that gives us a first person view at the moment of ches last breath this movie may not answer the questions of why che guevara was so stubborn why he was so determined he could pull it off even wen the odds were against him and why he deeply wants south america to have the same fate as cuba but the movie che is a story worth telling,positive
dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial brain dead and pointless the film is excellent the acting by both denzel and dakota she will go sky high trust me on thatare just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still havent watched your favorite one yettrust me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome see it rent it buy it or whateverjust dont miss it,positive

the most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called the great ladies of the grand guignol camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterdaywhats the matter with helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple in california debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing agnes moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ouchthe sloppy script penned by henry farrell the man who started all this genre with whatever happened to baby jane along with master director robert aldrich joan crawford and bette davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted motherhood with debbie and shelleys characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars and obsessive female bonding debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat texan are wasted instead we get debbie reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller but still this movie is highly entertaining the two stars and curtis harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws the movie recreation of the s is colorful and elegant look at debbies clothes made with a very tight budget the increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days and you wouldnt easily forget that silly goody goody song that runs through the movie either and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie reynolds chances at happiness is a hoot to watch out of,positive
not a good one not at allthis installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of amityville itselfits basically nothing my bet is that this film was made for some extra fast cash to buy a boat or something because this ones just ridiculous thankfully it doesnt kill or ruin the series but it just has no effect on the series at allid have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than the amityville curse,negative
it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie to put it bluntly its as if a dung monster defecated ate the result and then vomited the final product would still outshine this movieseemingly based on an ancient atari video game the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth the unleashing of demons and ancient civilizations something about there being two worlds that of darkness and that of light guess which ones ours oh and years ago a really super duper advanced civilization opened the portal demons came over and had a blast then wiped out the civilization which is why weve never heard of them conveniently enoughchristian slater perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume plays edward carnby a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was years old hes hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization carnby used to be part of a secret institution called which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long ago civilization but carnby believed he wasnt going to be able to find the answers he sought so he left the groupbut see these beasties are out and they get their prey in varying ways such as gutting them splitting them down the middle implanting neurological control devices in them or just turning them into killing zombies yes its another zombie moviethats about as distilled i can make the plot its pretty convoluted and incomprehensible in similar movies one might see the intrepid researcher adventurer figure things out a step at a time and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher its a lot of fun but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context not so much funthe acting is dreadful save for slater who although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie showed he was capable of carrying the acting load he had to get this tara reid is cast as a museum curator honest to goodness i thought id seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies but reid here matches richards crappy emoting for crappy emoting hightlights include reid pronouncing newfoundland as new fownd land reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed throaty monotone kinda like shed been on an all night bender for the past week before filming reid a museum curator mind you spending a lot of the movie in a midriff bearing top and hip hugger jeans oh yeah she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes oh why must the pretty ones be so dumb note i dont think tara reids all that good looking she looks like shes in perpetual need of food almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable except perhaps for steven dorff who played burke one of the leaders of dorffs character wasnt terribly well developed but nothing in the movie was from the sets to the characters to tara reid but i digressanyway the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding mind deadening soundtrack its so loud you cant hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes that cant be right given the acting level however perhaps thanks are in order to mr bolloh and a fun note the opening moments of the movie include narration of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time remember the first star wars you heard that now familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled there was surely no need for narration why do i need some doofus to read whats on the screen for me were the producers simply looking out for blind people maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud they were also looking out for hard of hearing people also the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl then lost it bizarrealone in the dark is a loud dopey mishmash of dreadful acting an incoherent script and ham handed directing hardly a note rings true theres so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise even in the dark the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparisonironically since there were only three other people in the theater i watched this alone in the dark i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way i cant quite give this the lowest rating because i had low hopes for it to begin with and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it its atrocious although slater redeems himself a tiny bit,negative
ill start with what i likedi really liked the songs everything about them was great the costumes music lyrics as long as the translation was good choreography everythingi loved the crab scene and the cooking scenebut thats about iti get it arty cinema blablabla but too much is too much too much silence it was interesting for an hour but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time really too much boredom no movie should ever be boring no matter how deep it was to be too much porn like scenes i do get it really i get that they were filming a porn movie there but really really really that is too much i truly think that cinema should be for watching and this one is definitely not watchable in no way stars for the songs,negative
this is a very underrated movie to say the least as has been pointed out in previous posts this movie has a somewhat loose and highly implausible script but you find yourself saying who cares while shooting milk or insert beverage of your choice here through your nose it was indeed due to a rare mix of actors in sync while kelsey grammar is obviously a gifted actor reference frasier this movie the supporting actors actress play their roles quite well i found in interesting how they threw in the part about duane martin blowing the shot in the big game for navys basketball team if any of you is a basketball fan youll remember martin from white men cant jump and above the rim and youll know that martin had a short stint in the nba with the knicks nice how they threw in believable character attributes such as this rob schneiders anal retentive character was the perfect offset to grammars calm demeanor lauren holly played the gutsy sexpot with a brain well enough to make you want her to succeed this is a movie that will make you laugh even if youve seen it many times beforethe comic bits in this movie definitely last i still find myself laughing years lateris that one of my chickens uhhhno this a parrotfrom the caribbean well dont let it fly awaythats supper arrrrrarr,positive
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with meto tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hothahahahabut i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his deathi was inside youi think thats what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that shes too young when he never cared how old the other girls werenow i dont think i myself could ever trust a cop like thatbut to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either wayand that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the storehahahahahashe was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello its called back upsometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid thingsbut thats what i think an thought about the movie,positive
back in do i remember that year clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of princess diana the marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets this was also the big year in the release of titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster i dont think anybody could have expected titanic to be as huge as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans of them being teenage girls i was years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times it was the film that made me believe that the love that jack and rose shared was so real and beautiful at the time i felt that titanic could do no wrong of course i grew up and didnt watch the film since i was a couple years ago i saw the film on dvd for and figured that it was a good price and to see what i thought about the movie now was it worth the hype was it really the best movie of all time was that leonardos real nose ok i know thats silly to say but i did re watch the film being completely honest here titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyagethe film starts with brock lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the rms titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the heart of the ocean unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the heart of the ocean dated the day the titanic sank year old rose dawson calvert learns of the drawing and contacts lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing she and her granddaughter elizabeth lizzy calvert visit lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship when asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace rose calvert recalls her memories aboard the titanic revealing for the first time that she was rose dewitt bukater in the upper class year old rose boards the ship with her fiancé cal hockley and her mother ruth dewitt bukater both of whom stress the importance of roses engagement to cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the dewitt bukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upper class rose and her mother are financially broke distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern before she leaps a drifter and artist named jack dawson intervenes jack and rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy first class formal dinner of the rapport building wealthy for a much livelier gathering of irish dance music and beer in third class but after cals servant informs him of roses whereabouts rose is forbidden from seeing jack again however after witnessing a woman encouraging her seven year old daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea rose defies him and her mother asking jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the heart of the ocean an engagement present from cal after a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the shipthey then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg after overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is rose tells jack they should warn her mother and cal meanwhile cal discovers roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames jack for stealing the heart of the ocean by having lovejoy plant it in jacks pocket upon learning cal intends to leave jack to die below deck rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him jack and rose return to the top deck cal and jack though enemies both want rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat but after realizing that she cannot leave jack rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with jack in the ships first class staircase jack and rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing atlantic taking jack and rose downso does titanic live up to its hype i still say that this is a great movie to watch i think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie but it has great acting amazing effects a well written story and still looks flawless love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of leos baby face or kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special it will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that i saw this film times in the theater when it was released but all that aside i do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day,positive
actually it was pretty funny in a god how the hell did this movie get made kind of way if you life making fun of movies which i kinda do go ahead and watch it but if youre actually thinking is this a good movie eff offthis movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting ive ever seen in any movie usually they get five minutes into it before you realize this movie might suck but no you know right off the bat this movie talks about edgar allen poe never tried to explain it though to people who havent memorized poes life story so i dont know if any of what was said is factthis movie is about a writer ethan poe hookin up with his cousin ann theyre both descendants of edgar allan poe or are they apparently people give a what their ancestors did this guy ethan poe is actually ethan usher who is supposed to be descendants from the story the house of usher that was written by edgar allen poe anns brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her anns also being stalked at one point in the movie by three different people on the same street seriously three theyre like right behind her glaring at her and she doesnt even realize the characters that are being murdered throughout show up at the end to try to save the day but they cant at the end ann shoots ethan while hes trying to kill her best friend of course before she shoots him she has to scream out nevermore this movie should be seen nevermore,negative
i saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in back when the tickets actually sold for this is the only film i have ever walked out on with my friend while the idiocy that is the laser bra sketch was on screen evidently my and my friends reaction to the film was a common one it is not that i found the film offensive either as an year old or now but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and patently unfunny devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a ed wood film watchable this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it rather than a failure to comprehend mr mikes vision unless of course his vision was to drive the films backers into bankruptcyi remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published worst films of all time list it certainly makes mine you have been warned,negative

gosh i am learning pretty fast that sometimes when you see a film as a youngster and then again years later you gain a different view primarily because in years you learn more for example i had no idea who george cukor was how great of a director he was and how much of that made this film fly all i can say isi really liked this film for it touched on an area that paralleled my life lifelong friendship between two women can that ever exist well in certain doses yesand this film let out in a bit on howbeing a youngster with not a lot of life experience at the first time i saw this so i focused more on the rich and famous part between the two at the time i had no idea there was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered there wasand how that would effect their friendship through their men their career the decades that defined them and coming to realize one thing remained stronger than anything elsetheir friendship and knowing each other more than anyone else could havethen i got older studied film a bit and watched this film again with my best friend from high school we do understand the rich and famous angle and we are still the best of friendsbut this film is not a cinematic masterpieceit can be seen as a bit campy at timesa little over the top at points kinda on a dynasty and dallas level to me and honestly i can identify with the teddy bear scene for we do share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men careers et also its not as over the top as it seems as many already said seeing meg ryan and matt latanzzi and dack rambo and david selby are great in this piece this is a nice chick flick,positive
like a lot of people i loved the original american graffiti was one of the great movies of the s the sequel more american graffiti is a horrible depressing mess of a movie it wasnt funny the wide eyed likable characters had become cynical and jaded and the stories were contrived such as lauries character having another brother because richard dreyfuss didnt do the sequel and terry the toad and pharaoh joe somehow managing to serve together in vietnam they even have a police officer by the name of falfa harrison fords character in the original who makes a cameo he doesnt even look like harrison ford who was way too big a star by to even bother with this garbagethe operative word here is funny this movie isnt even amusing debbie candy clark is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope spoking hippies and trying to bail her dealer boyfriend out of jail steve and laurie ron howard and cindy williams the lovebirds in the original have two kids and have become an annoying bickering couple adorable little tomboy carol mackenzie phillips has become rainbow yet another hippie child john milner paul lemat is a loser race car driver whose fortune was foretold at the end of the original even wolfman jack whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it such a great flow only is heard sporadicallyperhaps it was different writers a different director and the complete lack of a cohesive story line that makes this movie such a dismal failurethe episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere to be found in the sequel it was a movie that didnt need to be made and its best just to remember what a great movie american graffiti was and avoid the movie with more in the title,negative
okay so im a sucker for a good documentary particularly where it tells a modern day don quixote story a caveat i met mark borchardt in the winter of while he was still working on coven but ill save that story for later american movie which commenced production not long after accurately portrays the person that i knew although in greater depth than i expected or believed existed this is simultaneously a very funny and very sad film and is brilliantly executed mark comes across as his own worse enemy his childlike ambition and optimism which i admire is undermined by his apparent artistic ineptitude as well as his bizarre fiscal expectations but hes also a charismatic guy his loyal sancho panza sidekick is equally likeable loyal if frazzled to the core like don quixote american movie presents an often ignored inefficient aspect of freedom that people will be drawn toward professions to which they are not particularly well suited irrespective of repeated failure it is a great film,positive

spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty nobody should love that lucius shepardthe color purple takes place in the deep south during the early s and tells the story of celie and nettie two african american sisters the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire filmthe film then launches into a series of short sequences celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather gives birth in a dirty barn has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly forcing her to cook clean and look after his childrenall these horrific scenes are given little screen time and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography a meddlesome symphonic score incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes ten minutes he lasted a long timethe film is often said to deal which racism sexism and black culture but this is not true alice walker the author of the novel upon which the film is based claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian her book is a lesbian fantasy a story of female liberation and self discovery which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women for walker the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia black sisterhood and female independence celebratedspielbergs film however re frames walkers story through the lens of comforting american mythologies this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins stereotypical fat mammies jazz bands and gospel choirs this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike readily and happily accepting their social conditions a film in which black people are over sexed carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept this is not the old south this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind mgm muscals song of the south warner cartoons halleluha and banned disney movies in other words its the south as seen by a child raised on s tv its all so cartoonish so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracyof course in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed this reconciliation was in walkers novel but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kinbeyond walkers hate letter to black men and spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life we are shown nothing of the black community we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community instead spielbergs camera jumps about desperately fighting for our attention one of celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie every emotion over played the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith scored by a black man trying to emulate john williamsproblematic too is the lack of white characters consider this the men in this film arent portrayed as being rough to each other nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood no they are cruel by nature and the women whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed rather it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors women unable to support themselves and their children aloneand so theres a hidden ideology at work here late in the film one character tells another that since he didnt respect his wife she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you wont run afoul of the dominant white culture a failure to confront sex and lesbianism inappropriate musical numbers countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz incongruous comic business emphatic music cues and wildly hyped emotionality all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless,negative
perhaps its just the format of this film a documentary but i believe that the movie would have been much better served by good actors and more solid dialogue the fact that the actors are also the business owners is a double edged sword they know better than anyone else the emotions and complexities of the business they were in but since they are not professional actors they do a very poor job of conveying those emotions and the documentary suffers there were some truly memorable scenes in this movie and lots of good lines but they were delivered so poorly that they will fade away with time and the only memory i will have of this documentary is that it had some good scenes which i cant remember watch this if you want a first hand account of the com bust and see what happened to the of people in the industry who didnt become instant millionares however be prepared for some nauseating camera work poor acting poor dialogue and an overall bad movie that epitomizes the era of the internet boom,negative
this was a watchable movie but plot was a little weak and most of the jokes were from some of rodneys earlier movies with that said it was worth the time to watch i gave this a out of so basically its one of those movies that you do not go out of your way to see but if you find it on the tube take a chance,negative

i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too young to appreciate all of als subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film it is done in the mtv esque rockumentary style and tells a true but sometimes exaggerated tale of how al got to be where he was in you will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music,positive
thankfully i watched this film alone enabling me to fast forward through the worst scenes aka most of the film actually ok some of it is not all bad with partially good photography even some of the under water scenes and at times not too bad directing but it still doesnt save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting additionally when i dont find the movies hottie to be all that even the wannabe sexy love making scenes get dull really dull and for the drama you know its always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really dont care who lives and who diesif you still havent gotten tired of the reality series survivor you may find something to your liking in this movie if not stay well clear,negative

this movie has beautiful scenery unfortunately it has no plot in order to have a plot there must be a conflict this movie had none it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story tellingif you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just dont expect a story there isnt one,negative
i saw this movie on the lowlands festival th of august after a friend of mine said this is a very cool movie about the history of skating i didnt now what to expect from this movie was it recorded by a couple of skaters who thought they could do a couple of cool tricks or was it a documentary about skatingso i went in after waiting for about an hour whit out any expectationsthis movie is really a nice piece of work about the beginning of skateboarding it started with the zephyr team who where a fine group of surfers this is taking place in a not so nice area to live in at a certain point the waves are not so good any more to surf on so they try something else skateboarding was a fact if you were a part of the zephyr team in that time you where one of the cool guys girls because a lot of people saw an escape from the place they were living in with the zephyr team so they were trying all there new tricks now on a skateboard in no time skateboarding was popular again there were a couple of competitions and one national competition the zephyr team was taking part on several competition and also the national one but what they were doing on there skateboards was unbelievable but the jury didnt now how to judge them so they put the whole skateboarding world on its headanyway i can tell you the rest of the film documentary but you must see this one with youre own eyes because then you can feel the vibe of this movie this movie got a lot of style for me so i rewarded it with a greetings from gijs and the rest of holland see you,positive
when i first saw the movie being advertised i thought it was going to be another disney movie that almost goes straight to video i finally got around and rented it i thought it was going to be bad because i couldnt see shia in any other role than his recently cancelled show even stevens when i turned it on i was ready to turn it off from boredom in about ten minutes it started a bit slow and i couldnt understand the beginning because the years didnt make sense then they explained that later in the show so i was relieved of wondering about that all and all i thought it was a good movie and i would recommend it the cast was top notch and even though im not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot,positive
the magnitude of the stalingrad tragedy is concisely presented in the end note of the movie in the battle of stalingrad more than one million people were killed in action froze to death or died of starvation russians romanians italians hungarians germans austrians of the surrounded men of the sixth army o were taken prisoners of whom only returned to their homeland years laterwhat the story does not tell was that fieldmarshall paulus who surrendered did not share all the hardship of the captivity of his men he had a special treatment as the highest ranking prisonner taken by the soviet army when during his presence at the nuremberg trials he was asked about the fate of the prisoners he declared that they were fine he was freed after the war and died in the east germanythe film only presents the first part of the tragedy the actual battle of stalingrad however for an entire picture the fate of the prisonners should also not be forgotten,positive
this film has got so much in it prehistoric society adventure romance true brotherhood violence sex religion all depicted abundantlywithout a single word uttered and how come it sucks so bad this film will make you rethink the origin of humanity if this were the product of anthropology you would rather defy darwinian theory and hegelian synthesis all together you cannot bear to watch this even with your brain shut down and now you are thinking ive got to see this i warned you i take no responsibility whatsoever should you regret spending over an hour staring at this piece of art well i did warn you this should be forgotten and buried for ever,negative
the falcon and the snowman is the story of two young men a cia employee and a drug dealer who become disenchanted with united states foreign policy and sell state secrets to the soviet union the events of the film are based on a true storytimothy hutton and sean penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations the supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from david suchet of hercule poirot fame as a seasoned soviet agentthe film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in however it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle the ending however is tense stunning and effective there are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesnt fit with a spy story there are other spy films more worth seeking out than the falcon and the snowman but it is a decent film none the less,positive
strange almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie is it because its from and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling maybe its because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book i have not read the book but i dont think thats a problem film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts,negative
for years i hesitated watching this movie now i know why not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but theres also just nothing to laugh at about the movie it was even worse than id expected i rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money i have never seen a film that annoyed me that much it is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things i dont really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie i have used imdb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this stinker really a waste of time and money i must say that the plot line is awful,negative
this movie was by far the best ever i think whoever shot it with the sony hand held camera was a genius and the special effects were spectacular especially the chicken breast heartthank goodness this movie only cost me a dollar to rent also the green toxic boob discharge was amazingi could have shot this movie with my friends in high school i would not recommend this movie to anyone you might want to kill yourself instead of watching it i also feel like this was a move for porn stars trying to make it into the legitimate movie businessgive it to her larz,negative
sentimental and naive but undeniably affecting emotional man helping man plea in this case personified as german and french miners forced to be closed off from each other after the great war thanks to a new border leading to disillusionment on the german side as the french are the bosses but when a fire begins on the french side the common decency of the german men lead to assistance safety and even friendship this was a plea that would fall on deaf ears within the decade as a certain man from pabsts own side would break that piece and turn the great war into merely a prelude but it is obvious to me that pabst really believes or at least wants to hope for this kind of fundamental humanism as this film radiates with this optimism whereas his more flippant cynical adaptation of the threepenny opera lacked the bite needed to make that work work also furthering his honest belief are the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions but real people with real families whose home lives we are privy to as well these are ordinary working class men who just happen to believe in the worth of caring and treating right your fellow man and in this day of individualist opportunism ill take a little thinning in my plot to get a positive message that represents a point of view that i think we can all aspire tonote apparently the ending is cut on most prints where the french rebuild the mining gate closing off the men once again this is a brutal turn of events and may have made the film a better overall film but i would have lamented it souring the positives vibes of the final sequence so in short im glad it was clipped grade b of of,positive
a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that weve all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment,negative
this is why i still have nightmaresthis terrifying film a musical was considered appropriate for children in the sa boy leaves on a magical journey to an island the mayor of the island pufnstuf allegedly a dragon looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch billie halliday who was considered a bit of alright at the timethe flute is recovered at an interesting witches convention with the witches having a gay old time the boy dresses in drag then as a fairy to recover the flutenot suitable for children,positive
one of two movies i have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for even if it just to laugh at how bad it is i never found it for this movie nothing was good from the script to the very bad effects the worst movie i have ever seen,negative

i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen kings books this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorablei have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart wrenching as well as scarythe scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out and the no fair uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance,positive
okay yes this was a very tight budget movie with continuity errors like single scenes obviously filmed in sunshine and then in shadow and then mixed together and as much as i love nick mancuso he was often a little too good at the burnt out part and some of the minor supporting cast was really bad plus at least one actor was used for two different but conspicuous roles but come on richard grieco was hysterical his hair alone is worth the trip steven ford was very likable mancuso had some great lines while nancy allen ironically was completely bland and uninteresting classic no bad parts yes entertaining big yes i would have loved to have been on set the day they decided what kind of hairstyle grieco would have are you fast yaint that fast,positive
as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do ittill i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you cant believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example the santa claus gag others are so long that you cant believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example the students awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry dont get me wrong about every jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than out of,negative
i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely mediocre at its best the dialogue doesnt explain the story very well and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes there isnt one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting i just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love also cate and heaths love seems very incestuous they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers i dont understand why the father would accept something like that under his roofi watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like i said its extremely hard to like any of the characters katherine heigls performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasnt enough lines for aimee osbourne for me even to critique her performance johnny whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky he was the only person i sympathized with as for erika christensen and mike vogel they were supposed to be our heroines but came off as whiny and overdramatici just didnt enjoy this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band mxpx but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not i just pictured something so completely different,negative
easily lucio fulcis most respected film dont torture a duckling is highly renowned for its edgy subject matter gruesome imagery and strong storyline terror befalls a small italian village as young boys begin turning up murdered engulfing the confused and determined authorities plus a dedicated detective in mystery was it the creepy hermit the spastic voodoo witch one of the hookers the rich girl someone else contrary to most fans frequent representation on the films violent content i consider it much more plot driven featuring only one real moment of memorable bloodshed involving chains and boards in no aspect does this detract from the positive attributes this movie delivers fulci proves himself fully capable of dishing out one hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childing killing black magic and of course a nice full set o knockers though im particularly more fond of fulcis lizard in a womans skin and new york ripper dont torture a duckling dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery,positive
avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness but i personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title it gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links furthermore the way everything is connected at the end is in my opinion a bit pathetic what remains of it was a set of images an interesting one but not enough to make this a good movie i believe this film is supposed to be a comedy but i surely didnt noticed the nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable i have to say i fought hard to continue seeing it until the end and i am still not sure it was worth it,negative
i really enjoyed this movie it challenged my emotions and beliefs making it a true piece of artwork in my book the acting was unsurpassed i would never watch this movie with anyone i could not cry around i dont think i cry harder to any movies maybe because it makes me look at myself i dunno it is a must see,positive
i saw the pm showing and i must say that this movie was nothing special although i did not leave the theater wanting my time back as i dont actually pay for movies anymore i didnt really find any redeeming qualitiesthere were a few lines and such that made me chuckle but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger in mind more than age as this film is rated r male audience the fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well i know you all want to hear samuel l say his infamous line but lets be honest its a whole lot of hype for very little pay off the only truly horrible part of the film was the cg which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screennow i am a reasonable man i knew going into the theater that i wasnt going to be seeing casablanka and i am at least thankful that this film is an original albiet inane idea and not some re make or franchise spin off however to be honest if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months,negative
a surprising misfire from the usually reliable larry cohen god told me too q etc full moon high tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably even with decent turns by ed mcmahon and kenneth mars alan arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son adam simply looks numb this makes teen wolf look like a comedy classic,negative
well the artyfartyrati of cannes may have liked this film but not me i am afraid if you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you a large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness i did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless the only reason i did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot the plot however has little to recommend a large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people but lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth not recommended,negative
in the opening scene of malta story mr aguinness bore such a startling resemblance to noel coward that i fully expected his first words to be certain women need striking regularly like gongs or some such world weary bon motunfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to lifeindeed mr guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find oneand therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole moviemr jhawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a jack hawkins performance without an ounce of individualityit could have been spliced from any of a dozen british war moviesmany of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose the luftwaffe failed to bomb malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring london to its kneesthe courage of the maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the king and the island was awarded the george crossa worthy subject you might think for a moviebut malta story does not even qualify for the term worthy in its most patronising senseit gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadlineperhaps before the actors lost the will to live,negative

this movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects scenes where father merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination nothing seems to fit the story jumps from scene to scene the elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense the lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings there was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant from the terrible job the movie had done i would have never known that there were any tensions in the village if you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out exorcistthe beginning,negative
touching and sad movie portrays the trials and tribulations of a writer trying to come to terms with paralysis caused by a cycling accident the film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down and out and a white supremacist biker the film is often humorous often sad and always believable get out the box of kleenex and watch this on a cosy sunday afternoon with your partner,positive
spoilers abound you have been warnedi was thoroughly disappointed this being my first street fighter movie i have seen i dare not go near the joke yet very little grabs your attention in street fighter zero alpha as opposed to most japanimation the fights are hilariously done over board shun versus zangief was a laugher and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brotherthe main street fighter ryu has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother a shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter s mindwhat is with the artist s drawing of feet any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive the story s soft nature makes the street fighter genre far too intelligent and places far more emphasis on a character shun that is not even a fighter in the video game a character study on more than just the core stars of the original street fighter is completely ignored how many times did you catch rolento adon guy street fighter zero lacks the imagination of the video game,negative
some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media the makings of the film dont understand that the george romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films land of the dead withstanding this satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario whats subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter cut with the film nope furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since chud reared its hideous headmy grade d,negative
i am not sure who is writing theseglowing reviews for this movie but trust me it stkinks i have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is lame it is only about min long and believe me that is all i could take plot is terrible acting is even worse and there is no development at alleven the david cocteau films are better than this run away from jigsaw i expected to hate the acting which can be forgiven in direct to video movies if the plot is goodthis had no scares very little goreand a truly unattractive casti watched this with three other friendswho i hope are still talking to methey wanted me to fling the disc out the window i can not believe anyone could havegiven this tripe a good review,negative
so i was sick with the flu one saturday and the silver lining was that scifi channel was having a marathon of dinosaur movies that day the carnosaur trilogy pterodactyl raptor island then i flicked ahead on my cable remote to see which movie scifi placed in its glamorous saturday prime time slot some movie i had never heard of before called raptor i was pretty excited the movie begins with some teens driving around in a jeep when they get stalked and killed by a velociraptor i was like hmmm thats odd that looks almost exactly like a scene in carnosaur except it was in the middle of that movie then i sat through some really bad acting and then some guy was suckered into walking into an underground research laboratory where he got eaten by a ferocious t rex now im like wait a second that was also a scene in carnosaur then after i saw some scenes blatantly ripped off from carnosaur i figured out just what the hell was going on so basically roger corman co ripped off scenes from the carnosaur trilogy to use as the action scenes weaved in a basic dinosaur runs amok plot and tried to pass it off as an original movie shameful i dont know who im more angry at roger corman or scifi channel for trying to pass this off as worthy of the prime time slot the only reason why this was worth watching to its conclusion was to pick out the actors actresses who looked like their counterparts in the carnosaur trilogy and guess which scenes would be lifted next as much as it pains me being a dinosaur lover i have no choice but to give this the lowest possible rating because i feel completely ripped off,negative
vipul shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past waqt the race against time and namaste london were entertaining and interesting to watch singh is kinng was fun which he produced his latest outing as a filmmaker london dreams comes up as his careers weakest farelondon dreams has a mediocre storyline its about how success turns friendship into hatred agreed it has the potential but when you watch london dreams you wonder whats happening this film has maybe the worst climax in recent times vipul shah the writer puts vipul shah the director down the first hour is boring the second hour is better but again the climax is horrendous how can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you i wont ajay devgn suddenly decides to go to india and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy thanks to his uncle om puri when he reaches india rather than slapping or abusing him salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco was vipul shahs intension to show salmans character as a god if yes than youve failed completely the only question i want to ask vipul shah is that would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception write what you feel dont fool us the audience we are sensible enough to understand whats good or not this is a musical but the music by shankar eshaan loy is terrible not a single song stays in your mind salman is superb though he carries the film on his shoulders and does really really well in the emotional scenes but again his character is shown as a god which makes him look like a retard in the end ajay is equally good but salman has over shadowed him completely asin is wasted and what is a great talent like om puri doing in this film rannvijay hams though aditya roy kapoor excels brinda parekh is alright as the vampon the whole this dream remains a dream,negative
i once had a conversation with my parents who told me british cinema goers in the s and s would check to see a films country of origin before going to see it it didnt matter what the plot was or who was in it if it was an american movie people would want to see it and if it was british people wouldnt want to see it this might sound like a ridiculous generalisation but after seeing the astonished heart i can understand why people in those days preferred american cinema to the home grown variety back in the s british equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie everyone speaks in an english lad dee daa upper class accent that makes the british royal family sound like working class scum and what this does is alienate a large amount of a potential british audience who would no doubt prefer to be watching jimmy cagney in white heat because people would have if not related to then certainly empathised with a violent gangster in cinematic terms more than some high class english shrink in thats entertainment the reason people go to cinemas even the characters names seem bizarre leonora how many british people were named leonora in and the protagonists drink cocktails and they use words like austere you do get the feeling that this wasnt marketed for a mainstream british audience but why should it if the majority of british cinema goers were queuing up at cinemas to watch far more entertaining american imports watching the atsonished heart in i was astonished how dated everything was in fact its so dated i thought maybe it might be a spoof from the harry endfield show what didnt astonish me was the fact that these types of movie came close to sinking the british film industry an industry that didnt pick up until american money invested in crowd pleasers like zulu alfie and the james bond movies,negative
kevin kline offers a brilliant comic turn in the comedy in out kline plays howard brackett a small town history teacher who excitedly sits down to watch the academy awards this year because one of his former students matt dillon is a nominee he is nominated for his performance in a film where he plays a gay soldier and when he wins he thanks howard in his speech for inspiring him because howard is gay now this floors howard because he as no clue why thus guy would say this on international television howard is even engaged to be married to joan cusack in an oscar nominated performanceso he has no idea where dillons cameron drake got the idea that he is gay and finds he has to defend himself to everyone at school but is shocked that no one seemed terribly shocked by what cameron said on the oscars howard has a birthday party where he is given birthday presents like the soundtrack to yentl and ends up explaining to his guests why barbra streisand had to make funny lady his parents wilford brimley debbie reynolds are shocked but promise to support their son even if he is gay he also gets a visit from an out of town reporter tom selleck who wants to do an article about him because hes gay too the moment when selleck plants a big kiss right on klines lips is a classic but all of these little things have howard actually questioning his sexuality and wondering if he really is gaymuch to the aggravation and frustration of his fiancée cusack who is beyond confused the scene where she leaves a bar in her wedding gown and stands in the middle of street screaming about the lack of single straight men in the world is a classic but what i like about this movie is the way kline fully invests in the role and was not afraid to look foolish or look gay there is a fabulous scene probably the most famous from the film where he buys a record on how to be macho and the guy on the record is talking about how real men dont dance and a disco tune comes on i will survive if memory servesand the narrator on the record says no matter what you do dont dance but howard cant help himself and he ends up shaking his groove thing all over the room its hysterically funny and kline plays it with sincerity and gusto the film is not pro or anti gayits just a deft and amusing character study about a man trying to figure out exactly who he is wonderful film,positive

one of the few best films of all time the change from black and white to colour for the heaven and earth sequences was directorial excellencethe plot is extremely clever the complete film leaves you overwhelmed by all of the human emotions and although a war film it doesnt discriminate i must have seen this film more times than any other and i never tire of it it is a film that makes you question your own mortality and beliefs on what happens after our demise,positive
this show is what happened to the screen savers after g got its hands on it taking it from a useful source of computer related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someones posterioras gs ratings plummeted they moved away from their original target audience gamers to generic hormone driven young men adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust i look forward to the shows and the networks overwhelmingly overdue and well deserved demise,negative
the biggest problem with this film is that its nothing like bruce allmighty the first film played upon every daydreamers fantasy of being able to control ones surroundings as one sees fit evans experience though is entirely different he has none of the control that jim carrey fools around with and instead the story centers around the power of belief now this would have been fine since the first film was preaching the same message the problem is that the sequel does its preaching at the expense of the comic relief and to add insult to injury it also throws in politics into the plot you get the distinct feeling that there is a clear message with this film and its main objective is not to make you laugh to sum things up this movie is failed mixture of eddie murhphys the distinguished gentleman and charlton hestons the ten commandments im not sure if steve carrell is at fault here you get a sense that its his character that limits his abilities as a comedian the former news anchor evan baxter is not supposed to be funny hes basically an antagonist made into a protagonist which in this case only adds to the confusion of what this movies message is supposed to be about,negative
let me be up front i like pulp however it is like one of these easier dives that you see at the olympics it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painterthis is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chucklehowever quite why it has been given a worst film razzie is baffling i bet there was a thousand worse films made in but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a fashionable victim head case and popular novelist catherine tramell sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she cant even visit the toilet without tripping over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast penthouse flat one would come tumbling out in grand hollywood styleyes clearly a very dangerous lady to be circling around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such accusations seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of b s risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david morrissey for evaluation rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far crazier than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving blurin to this heady mix comes roy washburn a strange welsh sounding david thewlis who tells the love struck doctor in his capacity of policeman of many years standing that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too glassy eyed to realise or care like a dizzy boxer in front of a prime time mike tyson he ripe for the big take down however not before finding that washburn might have a secret or two himselfnow comes millena gardosh charlotte rampling a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isnt barking mad or else a murder suspect presuming that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of stones thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesnt think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else or else she doesnt think the script is good enough or her cheque large enough to do any proper actingafter several laps of the track roughly outlined above it comes to a climax that mixes provincial rep with a cliff hanger twist that while as farcical as the rest of the movie gives us enough elbowroom for basic instinct highly unlikely this may be at this point in time,positive

okay so i love aidan quinns acting even with a bad script this is not the case in the assignment as other viewers have said this was a movie i stumbled upon on cable and got so into it i didnt want it to end take one cuban american navy ofcquinnwho is an upright uptight soldier and family man add a crazed agentdonald sutherland who is looking for the worlds most notorious terrorist and add a ben kingsley and you have the assignment sutherland is a witness of the most notorious terrorist carlos actions in a cafe on a lovely day where he is so profoundly rocked at this mans evil that his sole reason to live is to get this man as long as he draws breathtake one soldier on a pass in israel who is a dead ringer for this man and is beaten and held by kingsley until they realize they have a plan by taking on carlos by being him or being forever responsible for never helping rid the world of him makes for a very heavy assignment and guilt trip by not helping his country he is bound as a man and his military duty to chose wisely so the training begins lets say carlos training is right up there with the academy of arts and holocausts when i say this intense and wonderfully castedscripted and executed film rates the best i am not understating it all three actors could save almost any scripttogether this is a movie to be seen from frame one to credits i am not into terrorism or movies about it but i got hooked bravo again to aidan quinn who for once plays a heavy that could hold up to any actor including gary oldman thats a compliment rent it and get lots of popcorn oh did i mention the sex it works better than last tangoand its educational,positive
life is really too short for movies like this i knew it couldnt be good when i realized what id already suspected that david schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in friendslets face it either the guy cant play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts i have a feeling that its a mixture of bothand i have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of gwyneth paltrow barbara hershey toni collette and carol kane,negative
not the funniest movie everbut i have to watch this film at least once a year just so i can fall in love with michelle johnson all over again she never looked better than she did in this film by the way the story is good too,negative
this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop the acting the noise and yet thats all it has some sense of a broadway without the bang the movie is slow paced the picture disjointed the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded its a musical disappointing sinatra intolerable sinatras fiancé surely the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice delight brandos understated singing very biasedsurprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes its the bone structure how i wouldve killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again,negative
wow its hard to put into words my feelings for this episode ice is one of the best episodes of season one for sure its my favorite of the season six people and a dog in a claustrophobic structure isolated in the middle of the arctic with an unknown organism that causes murderous aggression the drama cant get any better than that paranoia reigns supreme as even mulder and scully have doubts about each others sanity ive heard people complain about this episodes similarities to the movie the thing i havent seen it so i wouldnt know ice is more than worth watching just to see mulder and scully truly testing their still developing trust of one another this episode is intense and suspenseful to the end you wont be disappointed,positive
having been pleasantly surprised by sandra bullocks performance in miss congeniality i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in plucky self effacing roles ms bullocks performance in serious roles see hope floats speed days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time omniscient confused and sexually maladjusted the sub plot of sandras past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their forensics expertise and catch me if can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben chaplins token partner love interest characterspoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be traced to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause friction etc etc cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film purported to arrive at its conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of,negative
this movie has some beautiful sets and albert finney does a great job as the ruthless father the movie fails because jennifer jason leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for olivia de havillands far more nuanced mature rendering in the heiress the films feminist leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel washington square whose author henry james savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels as a fan of old hollywood and great literature i found this movie very disappointing,negative
a wonderful film a charming quirky family story a cross country journey filled with lots of interesting oddball stops along the way several very cool cameos great cast led by rod steiger carries the film along and leads to a surprise ending well directed shot a really nice movie,positive
this small quiet harmonious movie grows into a masterpiece on human dignity it is intelligently structured filled with meaningful little details and important side plots it tells a story of one man with great humanity without positioning itself politically but fostering life as a precious right not an obligation and underlining individuals right to choose it enjoys the richness of different landscapes mental and physical and languages important detail outstanding acting by each of the actors especially unbelievable javier bardem his screen presence has such a force that you forget that this is fiction the movie has a wonderful rhythm it is beautifully shot and outstandingly directed it takes real talent to make a movie on such a difficult theme with understanding humour and heart six stars out of five,positive
i watched this show on the basis of it being told it was reminiscent of david lynchs twin peaks a show which i adore the show quickly starts introducing us to the main characters and rather unusually the pilot episode is to me the best of the lot its extremely dramatic and really gets out the whole evil side of the show ready to progress throughout the rest of the season my one biggest criticism is i felt a little let down by the show probably not through its own fault as it got cancelled after a mere season it seemed to display show much potential and it deserved a lot better treatment than it got the acting is excellent and this show has some of the best characters good and evil in it i have ever seen that are well developed in a short space of time there is the odd cheesy effect for the first or ten shows which are a bit overly dramatic but this is rectified as the season progressed well worth a watch definitely something out of the ordinary,positive
i have seen many of shahrukhs movies and this is a very good role for him he has such versatility but he mainly stays in positive roles as rahul he is very dark and disturbing yet i found myself sympathizing with him much of the movie if for nothing else watch this movie for shahrukh he plays a very complex and real character very convincingly the story is very typical and has been done before but the character development is very strong and entertaining the opening is a little confusing but by the end it doesnt matter the songs i found very likable and give insight to what characters are thinking very clever i think this movie was very good and recommend it to all shahrukh khan fans it is a must see,positive
anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly i would refer them to roger eberts review of this movie he is one of the most respected critics in the industry and he gave it starsthis is a great movie it may not be perfect or spectacular but i enjoyed it a chorus line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway hopefuls i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between zach and cassie that is an incorrect view it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway hopefuls what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through and that i think is really the point of the whole show it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general this is a study of life as a broadway star anyone who has dreamed of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through this is a great musical it has its slow points and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed it take a closer look at the movie and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about,positive
love the tpbs but this was a lame episode didnt have the same feel that the series or the movie has looked like it was put together in a hurry i didnt enjoy it at all the so called acting was awful the cast appeared like they knew this was a money grab of an episode to get to market quickly i hope we dont have an easter special next because that will be it for me the writing of this episode was definitely mike clattenburgs worst in the history of this show the direction left a lot to be desired and i almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak attempt at a christmas special like i said i love the tpbs but this one goes to the trash bin,negative
reeves plays haji murad a hero in s russiathis is a badly dubbed movie with june foray doing some of the voices unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps anyone who says that japanese films are bad have never watched this filmthe films plot is instantly forgettable and so ive forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films it may have been a good thing for reeves but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through nooze fests such as this where its all court intrigue with very little actionin reeves defense he was a good actor he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good they all looked great but very few of them didnt put the those watching them into a coma for the films running timethis film will put you in a coma watch it only if you have the need for sleep and all other gentler means have failed,negative
judging from this film and the strong man made the same year i would not place harry langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians there simply is not enough there perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously in any event all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men but he lacks the acrobatic skills of keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of lloyd he also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like chaplins tramp character his trademarks are childlike innocence timidity of approach and a tendency to under react to calamity by looking perplexed batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger the comedy in langdons films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or nave ways or with a minimum of physicality such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away propping up a collapsing building with a two by four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him in this story about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross country walking race to publicize a rival companys footwear he manages to win by sheer luck there is nothing here that hasnt been done far better by the big three,negative
why this was an insipid uninspired and embarrassing film the embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made itpittsburgh pa why did they let these people do such a baaaaad movie therewhen this movie was originally to be releasedit was more of a romantic comedyand no robo anything that all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of disney why they did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character seeing matthew broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either sheesh,negative
for two of the funniest comedians the movie was awful fast forwarded it and never got any better waste of time and waste of money tina fey is such a great writer i thought that she would be so great in the comedy the previews were so great but they only showed the best parts of the movie my husband even thought that for a chick flick it sucked what is up with that movie was very slow ans boring i will not recommend it to anyone at this time i would like my money back for this one boo from us here in arizona thanks but no thanks who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant i thought that it was going to be so funny i have had my own children and i have helped others have children it could have been more along the lines of reality,negative

i watched the first episode and i found it to be a very wooden performancei have watched the original from its early days on big girls blouse to the last series on channel seven kath and kim was a great mocumentary and its humor is something that most people gethowever in this american version i found it to be dull molly shannon is to fashionable to be kath day kaths wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the s with her frizzy perm while selma blairs figure hugging clothes isnt as good as what the original kimmy wore i also found that selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot she is obviously a australian size where kim should be australian a size the exchanges from molly and selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldnt be pauses or the pauses are a bit long as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses its like molly and shannon are not used to each other there is no mother daughter chemistryphil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like kel however craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble brett from the aussie versioni found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play the acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of selmas expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes especially her sulking scenesto sum up i find this show to be a waste of time the script obviously has been dumbed down for americans which most on the board say they prefer the original if nbc wanted to show kath and kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the originalall i can add is magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of sharon,negative
after wasting hours of my life watching this movie on late night television i went back and reread some of the imdb material to remind myself of why i watched it in the first place in hindsight the only thing that i can think of is that the genre generally appeals to me but this movie was a total waste of effort it fails on every level and to see that its described on imdb as a comedy really leaves me at a loss i dont recall more than a couple of chuckles there are more laughs in any episode of law and order than in the last man seriouslytoo much of the characters interaction just didnt seem to me to have any foundation and was therefore very unlikely unbelievableif it hadnt been for the almost gratuitous bikini shots well what can i say avoid this movie like the plague or tape it and just fast forward to the bikini shots do not spend even to rent it though,negative
i found it charming nobody else but kiarostami can do so little and yet get so much you might think im weird but i was so charmed that i couldnt speak during the movie while during other movies i comment a lot the short movie made by him for lumiere et companie the one with the eggs that one is unbeatable in my heart but this is wonderful too i liked it better than ten kiarostami is maybe the best director in my opinion because he can see things he doesnt need to use a lot of stuff brought from home to illustrate his images he simply grabs a camera not many can do that maybe i dont know to much about movies but i dont care about complicate stuff all someone has to do is touch my soul kiarostami does,positive
gullivers travels is at the beginning a satiric novel written by a great misanthropist called jonathan swift so it is not recommended to judge of this movie just by itself we must go deeper into mans conscience to get to the point where swift would have lead us gulliver has lived a voyage of truthfulness of solitude of apprehension of what may be his true life we cannot just sit and watch that movie saying it is so cutie or so boring the matter is far beyond that and i would like everyone to expect that this is the greatest movie ever as far as you can feel the truths that emerge from ted dansons character the unforgettable lemuel gulliver,positive
never mind the serious logic gaps never mind the achingly cliche character portrayals never mind the haphazard writing and you might like this movie the main character alyssa was supposed to be endearing the heroine who you root for to be savedor in this case save herself but instead she merely grates and makes one wonder are all pro ballerinas really that stupid her busybody mother was obviously only necessary to further propagate the illusion that ballet companies are evil monsters ready to snatch your poor innocent young girl from your grasp with an ever present biting artistic director villain and the cliches not only does she become anorexic bulemic an over the counter junkie and a pathological liar but all in the course of a few months its like the writer read every horror story he could dig up about ballet and decided to see how much he could cram into two hours with commercialsbelieve it or not but i am a dancer this uprising or resurgence of anorexia and bulemia that is happening is nonexistent at all of the dance schools i have attended in fact the teachers are so scared to even suggest that a girl might stand a better chance a few pounds lighter most of the dancers in my classes would be actually considered minorly overweight im not saying eating disorders never occur but not to the extent as it was portrayed in the movieanother annoying problem this movie had was the means to an end writing style her on again off again boyfriend probably had all of half an hour total screen time all in the first half the other supporting characters were merely props decorations to further the story given the right dialogue this would have been a very intricate mind study of a psycological problem as it is it turns into a one woman show and kimberly mccullough doesnt have the chutzpah to pull it offto a non dancer this movie would be a supposed insight into what really goes one behind closed doors at a ballet company to a dancer this is a very insulting movie which portrays ballerinas as stupid and parents as pushy and ill informed those adjectives more correctly describe the people who got this on the air in the first place,negative
while there is a lot to recommend about maetel legend both in concept and finished product its ultimately a poor film plot wise its a retelling of maetels early life which is usually unclear at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the machine empire and since leiji matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for emeraldas her sister her mother the queen of la metalle and a bit of galaxy express to flesh out the filmin short maetel is a princess on the planet la metalle a planet with an irregular orbit thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and its artificial sun is dying the planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom in order to protect her subjects and family the queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of la metalles people enter lord hardgear a robot cyborg who provides the means for the job through the film the characters are left to question mechanisation will they still be human can hardgear be trusted do souls and hearts remain so for a fan of matsumotos work theres lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except its obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity the negatives foremost the animation while galaxy express a tv series from over years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design maetel legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to galaxy express the design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that slide as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms a quick way of animating however the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences repetition and in extra scenes anyone whos seem the film will wonder how many times lord hardgear can drink the same glass of winenext the story while in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film at least the newcomers wouldnt be left baffledand yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising the plight of the citizens of la metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing i guess i find that whole man machine theme distressing its hard know who to recommend maetel legend to since its not well animated written or executed plus confusing once leiji matsumotos mandatory cross referencing is introduced however i cant help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of three nine occurs now thats good cinema stars out of if youre a fan,negative

while sporadically engrossing including a few effectively tender moments and humorous the sledgehammer obvious satire homecoming hinges on comes off as forced and ultimately unfulfilling with material like this timing is everything michael moore knew to release fahrenheit before the elections and the real tragedy of dantes film is that it didnt come out years ago when its message would have carried an energy that would have energized the dissidents further in mockery of the well settled bush administration hardly seems as controversially compelling or imperiled as it did thenfrankly anyone that could be convinced of anything by a ham fisted zombie flick has questionable intelligence and if you didnt notice michael moore didnt exactly help to defeat bushthere was nothing engrossing about this film i just felt disgust at how blatant and frankly stupid the film was it was painful to watch if you are going to do something like this you need a bit of wit sadly this has none a poorly done satire actually has the opposite of its intended effect as they say with friends like these who needs enemies,negative
this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment promising to develop into something worth hanging on for but it doesnt its flat self conscious unimaginative and tediousa series of set images and backdrops dont make a film they make a calendar this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary its true it really happened not only fails to entertain it fails to convince so it doesnt even function as social history clichés co mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly the characters are one dimensional never developing to the extent that one feels for them the directors ego is the largest character in this film,negative
the sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and ive seen it many times since it always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well the flashback scenes are what really made it for me cristina rainess father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine its your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining the ending i consider to be one of the finest in horror history it has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing burgess meredith do his thing as chazen had me on the edge of my seat the sentinel has the perfect build up of tension we are never fully comfortable whenever allison is on screen we know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense this movie is often neglected among horror fans but i personally think its one of the better ones out there and it certainly has enough for all horror fans to be satisfiedperformances cristina raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part shes beautiful to look at and her chemistry with saranadon felt natural chris sarandon is great as the boyfriend michael he had an instant screen presence and i couldnt help but love him martin balsamjosé ferrerjohn carradineava gardnerarthur kennedysylvia milesdeborah raffinjerry orbachrichard dreyfussjeff goldblum and tom berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos burgess meredith is terrific as chazen he looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying eli wallachchristopher wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives beverly dangelo has one chilling scene that i wont spoilbottom line the sentinel is an effective horror film that horror fans sadly tend to neglect it will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied well worth the look,positive
i have not read the other comments on the film but judging from the average rating i can see that they are unlikely to be very complementaryi watched it for the second time with my children they absolutely loved it true it did not have the adults rolling around the floor but the sound of the childrens enjoyment made it seem soit is a true mel brooks farce with plenty of moral content how sad it is to be loved for our money not for whom we are and how fickle are our friends and associates there are many other films on a similar subject matter no doubt many of which will have a greater comic or emotional impact on adults its hard for me to imagine such an impact on the junior members of the family howeverhence for the children a from me,positive
first of all i personally adore demons and demons i saw them although it was hard to find good horrors without good official movie distributing here in russia when i was a kid and that is an unchangeable part of my boyhood then i heard nothing about mr bava then i saw his ghost son well it is certainly not a good coming back why was the leading character whom we never really knew to at least like him in accident in the middle of an empty road why do african servants say so dumb and stupid things about human soul why is the plot so primitive havent we seen enough ghosts for years of movie production it is clear that lamberto bava has nothing to show us so far it is a shame,negative
its hard to believe that there are some people out there in the world that actually think this is a worthy charles bronson vehicle bronson is a good actor that can do more than tote a gun and knock off bad guys he was quietly moving in the tv movie yes virginia there is a santa claus and showed a lot of class and style in the sean penn directed the indian runnerin the evil that men do however bronson again plays a character that sees injustice and sets it right with fists knives and of course guns theres nothing here you havent seen in the last five death wish flicks wait i take that back this has to be the most sadistic and repellently violent film bronson has ever had the dis service of being in not just repellent in the scenes of torture or the descriptions of torture but in the fact that these scenes were put in a film just to sell tickets and jose ferrer what in blue blazes was he doing here i mean he won an oscar for crying out loud okay sorry about that outburst let me just say that the evil that men do has to be one of the worst movies i had ever seen that was based on a book yeah thats right i wonder if it was written with bronson in mindno stars watch death wish instead at least it was topical,negative
a couple of years back i had purchased and enjoyed the mgm double feature dvd of the two kolchak tv movies the night stalker and the night strangler when the universal set of the subsequent tv series came out i had intended to buy it immediately but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded dvd s kept me from adding it to my collection recently i placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted universal box sets and decided to pick up the kolchak discer as wellhaving watched it now i can safely say that i didnt regret acquiring this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula dogged and resourceful newspaperman carl kolchak marvelously played by darren mcgavin gets into everybodys hair with his attitude flustered editor simon oakland long suffering colleagues assorted authoritarian figures a plethora of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is pressured into keeping his story under wraps but a winning one further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of funthat said quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment not to mention the fact that these were restricted to minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes in the case of the werewolf again hes never seen biting anyone but somewhat foolishly is made to merely throw people around while the heros cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots theres a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around mcgavins relationship with either oakland or geeky reporter jack grinnage to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is chicago and suspense to make the ride even more pleasant theres a bouncy score by gil melle and jerry fieldingfor the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by kolchak throughout the series are a revived jack the ripper a variety of cults voodoo native american aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner doppelganger satanist swamp creature mass of electricity robot apeman witch headless motorcyclist succubus a knights armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast featuring john dehner as a morose police captain hans conried and robert emhardt helen of troy and crocodile some of the actors other than those playing kolchaks co workers return in the same roles keenan wynn and ramon bieri both as officers of the law john fiedler as a shrewd morgue attendant and richard kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero if i were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes id lean towards horror in the heights co starring phil silvers and abraham sofaer and the afore mentioned the knightly murders while as the weakest id go for the werewolf due to reasons ive already explained and chopper based on a story concocted by robert zemeckis and bob galeunfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in kolchak the night stalker as well as putting the series into the context of where tv was at the time of its original airing or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today in fact kolchak himself in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise returned in a revival this version is available at my local dvd rental outletbut for various reasons im not sure id want to check it out so soon after the classic,positive
i dont know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess thats what reviews are personal taste missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs taboos of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of equality guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally i thought under the skin you have to submit to the aire of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty insides excellent and actually very cruel,positive
the old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in women in love the script taken from d h lawrences novel contains an endless flow of concepts that are at best sophomoricwhat a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise what an empty array of characters given such attention in spite of high production values this film comes across as tedious as its personnela revisit in merely confirms a impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies dawdling nowhere and fumbling every step of the way,negative
rarely seen a movie that deviates so much from the original premise and still remains more or less acceptable bloodline is a rather short which is a good thing in this case escapade that focuses on the mysterious hellraiser box who wanted it to be made and how it cast a spell on the entire bloodline of the man who eventually created it were introduced to generations of the merchant family all played by bruce ramsey one in th century paris one in the present day and the last one in a future galaxy far far away opinions on this storyline may differ a lot either you think its very idiotic and far fetched or original and dared the initial atmosphere and setting by clive barker has completely vanished yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling hellraiser bloodline contains quite a lot of exquisite slaughtering and the charismatic presence of pinhead doug bradley still is an extra horror value pinhead accompanied by a pet puppy this time still knows how to kill too bad he talks too much and his vicious speeches tend to get boring quickly best aspects in this production are the newly introduced cenobites and the occult parisian portrait giant turn offs are the weak script the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to barkers initial masterpiece although not highly memorable itself bloodline stands as the last watchable hellraiser film after this sequel the series went downhill completely so far more sequels came out more are still in process and neither of those is worth seeing hellraiserbloodline suffered from a lot of production difficulties and the director eventually preferred to be credited as alan smithee meaning he doesnt want to be remembered as the director of it who could blame him,negative
i knowi know its difficult if not paradoxical for there to be such a thing as believable fantasy but to me there is also such a condition wherein too much unbelievability interferes with or distracts from my overall opinion of the movie the latter was the case for me with regard to goliath awaits not only did i have too many unanswered questions concerning the storyline but some of the acting too i thought was a bit over the top maybe though it was the writing asking them to recite too many trite predictable cliched over reactions others have said enough about the plot i just wish that it was done and i think that it could have been more convincingly p s this is a fresh comment about this film i just finished watching it a couple of minutes ago not a recollection from years ago,negative

first off just let me say that i live in south africa where rugby is our biggest sport by far and our national side the springboks have won the rugby world cup twice so its quite a big deal over here ive played all my life and im shocked at the poor attention to detail in this movie at first i thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of neal mcdonough nick ferris gary cole and sean astin for goodness sake but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport they basically mashed it together with your normal everyday american football moviemy first problem is that this movie supposedly captures the values of rugby but the discipline or should i say the total lack thereof during the games are contradictory to this in the final it looks more like an nfl game with penning being tackled of the ball numerous times in front of the refereethat wouldve immediately led to a couple of red cards because foul play like that would never go unpunished in by a referee of that i can assure you youd also not be able to find a coach in world rugby who would have so little control over his team any coach would take a dump on a players head if he intentionally stiff arms an opposing player or double teams him like they did in the finalred card and certain suspension full stopsecondly its absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played wing all of his life i gather move him to hooker which is a highly specialized position and say that its for the good of the team what hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to scrum extremely well and preferably be able to throw the ball in at line out time which penning never does for some or other reason by moving a wing to hooker without any extensive long term training it would firstly lead to your teams demise at scrum time secondly the poor kid would probably break his neck how is that good for the team i ask you finally the overall high emotional pitch of the movie is way too much because even though rugby is a great sport and it builds great friendships team spirit it rarely gets that out of hand corny ive seen true life football dramas with less emotion than this movie it turned out great but in this one seans penning acting skills is dragged way too far and the movie attempts too force an emotional response out of the audience which ends up being boring and hard to watch at timeshollywood have made some great sports movies over the years but next time they venture into a sport which has just recently picked up in the states they should try and do their homework maybe get some experts into the fraydo it right or dont do it at all,negative
in the first transformation scene what is the music ive heard it was the greeks dont get no freeks is that right i really liked that sound i also liked the hydes got nothing to hide in the final scenes truly a doper movie but with many laughs and puns sight gags and slapstick madam woo woos place was reminiscent of some places i have visited myself ivy venus has appeared in some other stuff that is truly amazing she looks much different in the movie were talking about but her maturity didnt hurt her a bit mark blankfield reminds one of gene wilder in some ways bess armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time,positive
this movie was not only disappointing to the horror suspense film lover it was disappointing to anyone who sees it wow i thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head however it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasnt needed there was so much sex that i hate women and men now this film was not only boring but there was no substance wow wow on to of all this each scene looks like it was light from a single light bulb and i think they used the same set for two different lawyers a restaurant and an airport this movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the end it feels likes wasted time see the movie party,negative
this was a pretty decent movie this movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained just a typical hollywood film this movie will never win an oscar or anything and definitely doesnt deserve one but i thought it was pretty good its kind of like the show but set into movie format if you like the whole weve got to stop the terrorist from killing the president kind of movie then you will enjoy this flick i personally think that storyline has been done way too much but the sentinel does add a little twist with the mole in the secret service all in all this movie wont leave your jaw to the floor or change your life but who says every single movie has to be like that to be good,positive
having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know its cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold that doesnt feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like theyre running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and its so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside vancouver it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt russel sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as russel and not nearly as good an actor as russel and russells way of playing o neill well he was much more cynical andersons o neil is way too soft i liked it that russels version just didnt give a s and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie michael shanks does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james spadertealc is a really annoying character he is jaffa not a jaffa just jaffa aaaarrgh a former bodyguard of a pathetic ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far tealc speaks talks and acts like a robot ive seen better acting from jean claude van dammeand the fact that tealc and the ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with crystals its so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background its an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in that was years before sg started and they didnt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg supposedly had they must have spend all the money on catering because i dont see it on the screen incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters,negative
while not quite as good as a murder is announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation and you know what it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version now i dont take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations worst being sittaford mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book it is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent the performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general well done script with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple and solid turns from liz fraser helen cherry joanna hole and anna cropper margaret tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as clothilde overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments bethany cox,positive
i would probably say this was on a par with films like devils rain and that sort of film although this is probably a bit better made i love s horror and this has most of the elements that make up other movies i like so it was pretty easy to enjoy a family on their vacation stumble across a small town where the people seem to be gripped by some sort of hysteria seems like the children have been disappearing after an initial attempt to flee this place the family is somehow stopped on the edge of town and find their way back but not without first finding a house where the kids are gone and mommy and daddy are dead seems like we have a different kind of twist on a senior citizen community center in this town theyre all satan worshipers and they need the kids to renew their lives so they can continue on in their service i guess not that anyone seems too keen on giving up their kids for this enterprise this is fairly classy considering that its scary and creepy without buckets of gore or the loud startling events that try to make people jump in films today which seem to have replaced actual scares we have hank kimball alvy moore from green acres as tobey a sheriffs deputy that reads ufo magazines and lq jones as the sheriff and a very familiar character actor as the dad of the stranded family and strother martin plays the doctor who seems to be doing double duty unbeknown to his fellow townsfolk this is pretty good stuff but a tad on the confusing side sometimes but overall works pretty well is recommended for fans of s horror out of,positive
lucio fulci a director not exactly renowned for his subtlety ill advisedly tries his hand at black humour in touch of death a made for tv movie about lester parsons brett halsey a psycho who seduces and murders rich widows in order to pay his gambling debtsstarting off with a wonderfully gory scene in which the lethal lothario disposes of his latest victim via chainsaw mincing machine and hungry hogs touch of death starts promisingly enough but fulci soon loses control of proceedings introducing a weird sub plot involving a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed comedic scenes there are several more graphic murders which in true fulci fashion are extremely violent and gruesome but even the high level of bloodletting doesnt stop this from being one of fulcis poorer effortsas i have found with many of his other movies a comprehensible storyline is not exactly high on the agenda when lucio is behind the camera this film has many peculiarities which left me more than little perplexed why didnt lester dispose all of his victims using the dismemberment method seen at the beginning why are all of his victims either hairy or disfigured what the hell is that ending all aboutfulci is considered by many to be one of the greats of horror cinema i dont understand his popularity finding the majority of the films of his that i have seen so far to be generally lacking both decent narratives and technical proficiency touch of death certainly does nothing to change my opinion,negative
i saw this on mystery science theater and even that show couldnt really make this movie bearable i could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures of course you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old but ive seen silents that were better the storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes the cameraman apparently doesnt know what a tripod is and had too much coffee or something harder maybe because the camera is always shaking around i couldnt even follow the plot but suffice it to say this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen in my lifeupdate i saw epic movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a its not the worst movie ive ever seen anymore,negative
used to watch this when i was very little then used to watch my videos now i watch the dvds i love this ray winston is the dude the rest of the cast is all good and even with the changing of robin hood it all works great stories twists and the way it was shot to the untrained eye not that mine is trained can be miss interpreted as being ropey but it adds to the films absorption of the audience with the green hillsides and the contrast of the lush sunny lit forest to the dark corridors and dungeons of the castles its great personally the definitive interpretation of the robin hood legend i cannot stress how much i think you should watch this if you get a chance then you must watch it,positive
i saw this at a drive in when i was all i remember are a few scenes the ones where the main character elle is being chased by a guy in a mask and being scared spitless seeing it now my opinions have changed its a pathetic horror film about an ophanage run by gloria grahame sad and dealing with a young talentless girl elle who is sent there after her mother the town tramp was beaten to death with a hammer graphically shown the film has adolescents actually actors in their s being beaten tortured killed starved attacked with meat cleavers raped etc etc the brutal hammer murder is the opening scene and then it gets worse and worse there is nothing to recommend about this crap the plot is stupid all the dialogue is bad and the actingthe less said the better how did this sickie get by with a gp now pg rating it would get an r now worthless one last thinga truly repulsive twist ending suggests incest,negative

this was a well written tale of the making of the batman sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their tv shows history unlike the bradys and partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of adam and burt but also get to see them back in action filled with kapows and catwomen and the riddlers batman is back ina well told tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the batman series but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that havent been heard in yearskudos,positive
gamera vs viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a resultspace aliens try to take over earth and are stopped by gamera so they send another ship that manages to kidnap two young boys the aliens then take control of gamera and get him to attack mankindfirst of all i must say that i really enjoyed the monster fight at the end between gamera and viras viras looks like a big squid with a beak he has no energy weopons and does not shoot any rays out but he can close the apendages on top of his head to make a sharp pointy weopon so overall this is not a bad monster for gamera to fight and is decent viras really injures gamera badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointy head and i am surprised gamera was able to survive thisunfortunately gamera vs viras decided to use footage from previous gamera films to fill time for this film they re show the battles between gamera and barugon and gamera and gaos when the aliens look at gameras past battles however when they show gameras battles with gaos they show the battle between gamera and gaos in the city first then they show the final battle between the two after they show re used footage of the final battle between gamera and gaos they show the first battle between gamera and gaos talk about showing the battles in non chronological order they did not even need to show the first battle they should have just stopped after they showed the final battle between the twoanother issue is that they decide to re show footage of gamera attacking cities when the aliens order him to attack tokyo so they show the scene from gamera vs barugon where he destroys the dam after the show scenes from gamera the invincible which is a huge issue for me mainly due to the fact that gamera the invincible was in black and white using stock footage from a black and white film in a color film is really lazy and that is not a good thingalso the dubbing is bad once again the two little kids are not that annoying but it would be nice to see a gamera film that did not involve little kidsso the over use of footage from other gamera films is a deterrant to this film the final fight is awesome so basically i recommend skipping to the final ten minutes and watching this film the rest is something that has already been seen before,negative
look no further this is it the worst movie ever made there may be others that are tied but there are none worse there cant bei found this movie on a clearance sale laserdisc for and thought no movie with those actors could possibly not be worth that price turns out its worth triple that as the minimum they should have paid me to watch itim virtually certain that the girl in the picture on the cover of the package is not the girl in the movie they substituted someone else someone younger and cuter to make it look more appealing whatever plot there was amounted to about three minutes of actual movie the rest is filler and i dont mean the kind of filler that you only realize is filler when its over or that is some kind of eye candy you dont mind having there i mean filler that has you thinking about your shopping list i think the music must have been made up by somebody with a friend who had a radio he listened to once its terribleif there were a shot of a nice mountain a river valley a forest anything there would be something positive about this movie there isnt even with the speeder button on the remote even at top laserdisc speed you cant get it over with fast enoughafter years of thinking about commenting on movies being tempted but not registering with imdb i finally cracked because i had to do my part to push the user rating on this stinker down as far as possiblethe guidelines ask that you focus on the content and context i cant there isnt enough content to focus on and thats exactly my point sometimes bad is just bad and this movie would have to be much better than it is to aspire to being only that,negative
being a huge fan of the bottom series i was really looking forward to the release of this filmi was eagerly anticipating a laugh a minute roller coaster ridealaswhere to start on this messi think its a good start to say that its hardly richie and eddie on our screens in the first place as none of the jokes and one liners they usually deliver so well are funnyi was still waiting for the first laugh after a good minutes of viewingmany aspects of the story were pathetic and it was as if the film was full of those bad moments they rehearsed and decided to leave out of the final cutthe overall sets and atmosphere surrounding the film is dark and dingy which i suppose is good if they want to portray the terrible guest house the buffoons attempt to runbut to me its just puts an even higher dampener on a sorry state of filming that should never have been createdthe actingat timesis patheticfenella fielding is wasted as the loony mrs foxfur and ive seen simon pegg have much better outingsid recommend guest house paradiso to anybody who is blind drunk because they might appreciate the terrible puns much morebut to any bottom fan who hasnt seen this film and is expecting true richie and eddie action you have been warned,negative
super original really great movie james franco and sienna miller really do go so well together on screen i sure hope it comes out soon i first saw this movie at a screening because of my age and gender i was asked to stay for a talk we all got to comment on the movie and a lot of people didnt seem to like it i really loved it and i dont know why so many people didnt think it was that good go see it when it comes out and decide for yourself one thing that you might want to do if you are going to see this movie is to go into it not knowing anything about it i had not known anything when i went to the screening other than it was called camile it really is worth seeing,positive
you could stage a version of charles dickens a christmas carol with sock puppets and ill probably watch it ever since i was a child this has been one of my favorite stories maybe its the idea that there is good in everyone and that therefore no one is beyond redemption that appeals to me but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when theyre on tv as they inevitably are this time of yearwhat makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles lines weve heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemblegeorge c scott was nominated for an emmy in for this role it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft portrayed role of scrooge he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was in my opinion one of his finest performances ever he wisely did not attempt a british accent instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man as he is so often portrayed but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits we understand how this anger took root grew and ultimately strangled his soul as he is forced to review his life we see him alternately softening and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy and in the great dramatic scene when he kneeling and weeping at his own grave begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully humanimpressive as scotts performance is the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this versions dark beauty fred holywell scrooges nephew is an excellent example of this often portrayed as an affable buffoon here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals when he implores scrooge i ask nothing of you i want nothing from you why cant we be friends we see in his face not only his frustration but his pain at scrooges self imposed separation from his only living relative it is a moving performance and one of the movies most dramatic sceneseven more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooges late partner jacob marley in most versions of this tale the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film simply because its difficult to portray a dead man convincingly and the results are usually just plain silly ooooh look its a scary ghostnot in this version it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie marleys entrance as the locks on scrooges door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house is wonderfully creepy but finlays marley is no ethereal spirit he is a tortured soul inspiring both horror and pity marley may be a ghost but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress are still very human as portrayed by finlay we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition finlay really steals the scene here something not easy to do when youre opposite george c scottand it just goes on and on one remarkable performance after another making it seem like youre experiencing this story for the first time edward woodward remember him from the equalizer is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present when he delivers the famous line it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spankingsusannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs cratchit and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty a sick child and an insufferable boss his face alternately shows his cheerful courage and also at times his weariness in the face of intolerable circumstances later in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim warners performance while hardly uttering a word will move you to tears,positive

first a technical review the script is so slow it is really a minute story blown up to hour min the dialogue is so flat and truly one dimensional the acting is pathetic they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board as for the whole point of the story namely war is bad oh theres a shock is really non existent without out the lets shock em and get great publicity scene nobody would be talking about this film it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on believe me ive seen some bad emperors new clothes films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this read all the other reviews avoid at all costs and dont talk about it,negative

jerry spies tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesisi didnt find this particular episode that funny the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame jerry is essentially the bad guy in this one tormenting poor tom for no particular reasonthere is the occasional flash of inspiration such as toms literal heart in mouth experience and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body but on the whole this effort lacks the frenetic pacing excellent animation and sheer wit of most of tjs other cartoons,negative
wow i just dont even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful maybe i should start by just saying that during a heated confrontation between the antagonist and protagonist i had to leave the theater because i was laughing so hard yeah the acting really was that bad the acting was not even the worst part though the plot was almost entirely shown in the previews the characters are all grossly underdeveloped the dialogue and dramatic moments are ridiculous the bad guy is a caricature of an out of control power drunk sadistbut hey the actors are pretty so guess that was supposed to make it all better,negative

this really is a film of two halves the first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys one a privileged pashtun and the other a down trodden hazara in late s afghanistan before the invasion by the ussr works extremely well the young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark reliefthe real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the pashtun as a man living in america ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down the central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity it is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see that of his boyhood friendonce he returns to afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately even though he is not looking for him despite the chaos that has since consumed the country this enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible the resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to makealthough it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion instead the narrative becomes reduced to one characters emotional journey of self discovery and healing unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about afghanistan itself are wasted,negative

some people have stated that as of the th season south park has started a trend of leaving behind their politically biting satire for shallow spoofs but this could not be further from the truthwhile this episode does spoof the living dead series there is more it is a satire of how people treat the homeless characters say things like theyre pretending to be just like us or they want to be human this episode attacks a culture of people who ignore the lower class who are often just down on their luckso yes it is still a satire and also a wonderful spoof what more could you want,positive
exclusively for coops lovers though clint eastwood very strong though unobtrusive presence is a great asset of this very good documentary film it is a biography of gary cooper based mainly on his filmography but also on more private archives which show him as a child as a young man as a family man with some of his friends picasso hemingway etc as an older man finally as a sick and close to death man after the end i did not have the feeling that i knew the man any much better but i have spent a very good moment re viewing many of the best moments of his movies and my respect for the very talented actor and great professional was increased tenfold the film shows most interestingly how the career of cooper can be paralleled with the evolution of usa society before and after ww two of the great moments are the time when cooper has to answer justice about communism in the movie world and when james stewart a very great one too received an award for cooper one month before his death im not a weeping pot but that was a close one watch it if you can it is so much worth while if you love cooper that is or an older america,positive
a very good episode although not as devastating a finale as the end of season the idea to make it a desmond flashback worked very well and henry ian cusick was fantastic perhaps putting in the best performance of this entire series but my only complaint would be the michael plot line felt very much like a subplot and after three minutes the previous episode i thought it would feature more but the strength of cusicks character and performance pulled it through the plot developments as always left more questions then answers like who are the others something we still dont know and where are they taking jack sawyer and kate what was the white light what impact has it had are locke eko and desmond dead as the hatch destructed around them if they are it would be a major mistake because these three are the most interesting characters and the series would suffer without them and terry oquinn has been fantastic throughout both series as locke a fitting finale to a better series then the first,positive
i was looking forward to kathryn bigelows movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and oscars which it was awarded unfortunately it really isnt a good movie the depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard the actors put in a good effort but for me i didnt really get what the movie was trying to be its not as atmospheric and gripping as full metal jacket not as epic as band of brothers not as action packed aswell anything i certainly cant see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are hyping it up to these epic proportions mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years i suppose theres not a lot to choose from,negative
clean family oriented movie i laughed i criedi loved it i was worried i wouldnt be able to see steve carrell as anything but goofy michael from the office boy was i wrong he should win an oscar for his performance i will definitely buy this on dvd when it comes out my husband enjoyed it and he isnt into movies of this type i saw it with other couples in the year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a long time and certainly the cleanest only cuss word not even sure why it was pg i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy drama romance and more,positive
wellnow that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his house of corpses crapfest i can now rest in peace nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in the house of seven corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former abode in hell house sorry i dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago some like arthritic lurch stand in john carradine whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum the result comes across like satans school for girls catchy title made for tv production values intriguing plot crossed with children shouldnt play with dead things low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun the house of seven corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second,negative
sure i like short cartoons but i didnt like this one naturally kids would love it but then again im not a kid anymore although i still consider myself youngi will not tell you anything about the story for the simple reason there is no story how is it possible this dragon of a cartoon was nominated for an oscar well i guess its because people in the s were more happy with not much than now in the present where we live everything must happen fast look at the movies nowadays and you will come to the same conclusion we live in a society that doesnt allow men to be slow thats really a shame i wish i lived in the s because it seems so peaceful but every time has got its ups and downs i guessto conclude if you like music and frogs youll have to see this cartoon otherwise dont spill your time on it,negative

im giving this movie a because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system this movie was horrible it was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film i wont even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isnt good enough for plot spoilers to write comments on the plot would be pointless if i were to compare this movie id have to compare it to reign of fire however although i didnt like reign of fire either that movie at least was better than this one some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done the only reason i didnt was because i simply didnt think to do it i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done but that isnt what happened the martial arts lasted all of seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash back scene very disappointing the cgi was not done well either one scene comes to mind during one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away atnothing someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys im also thinking the bad guys voice was dubbed by the voice over of imotep from the mummy movies had that same scraggly echoing thing going on someone owed some royalties here since i mentioned the fight scene ill say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the purists i supposedont go see it dont buy the dvd when it comes out either you have been warned,negative

this movie will undoubtably not go over well with some because most of the horror is mental but it does have a little something for almost everyone including a couple of really cool abduction scenes with aliens the film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology while also showing a bit more intelligence about some facets of abduction myths than you would expect out of a movie jillian mcwhirter is excellent in what had to have been a grueling performance,positive

im a great admirer of lon chaney but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me the story jumps around oddly ive since learned that the film is missing a section and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness some of the intertitles are overly explanatory eg why youre not a child anymore cut back to picture for a long slow beat youre a woman yes we got it the first time but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear lets hear luigi and his blond girlfriends argument please the plot which involves incestuous desires figuratively if not technically was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch to the writers credit this issue was treated as a problem and a may december match is not portrayed as the right and good inevitability of some mary pickford films eg daddy long legs chaney gives a good performance as usual but i think he has been better directed in the past he overdid it a few times here imho i did enjoy the clown sequences and was very impressed at the stunts loretta young was charming though astonishingly young the film has its moments but so far its my least favorite chaney picture,negative

a good film with for its time an intense sprawling rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of john fords the searchers though not so brutal the story starts fast and doesnt let up with several scenes of really good dialog between stewarts jeff webster ronda castle and sheriff gannon this film is in some ways reminiscent of bend of the river also a mann stewart work but i found it far less sentimental and more interesting there are a few caveats a too quickly wrapped up and rather sentimental ending year old corrine calvert is not very convincing as a naive french teenager and of course the film takes place in the mythic west a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics dont apply but these are trivial concerns james stewart is surprisingly good as a dark disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself and the mountain scenery cant be beat a fine western costume drama,positive
i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action filmsive seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the poorest and its rather disappointingmask of the phantasm would rank as the best then worlds finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks lastin this newest animated movie theres a mysterious new batgirl in gotham and batman is intent on discovering whether shes friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeancebut as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirlthe tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are re used from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting theyre really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of sub zero which was heavy in drama and character developmenteverything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting forall the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising but this wasnt as exciting as id hopedhalf out of,positive
this is a film that has it all the dashing hero the beautiful damsel in distress the noble figure with the tragic flaw and a truly wonderful robot forbidden planet has maintained that special magic over the years and doesnt lose its flavor with repeated viewings although the sex appeal of the youthful anne francis helps considerably on that scoremovie fans will recognize the youngish leslie nielsen portraying the handsome and heroic commander adams although those of us who have grown fond of him in comedic roles will perhaps be a bit taken aback by his appearance in a serious role the distinguished and noble looking walter pidgeon is also a featured player as the scientist with a secret id other supporting cast deserve a nod especially warren stevens as the brainy and resourceful doc and of course the charms of miss francis as noted abovethis film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music in the s no less the credits call them tonalities but those of us who tried to tinker together early versions of the theremin device will recognize the eerie and spooky whines and screeches sometimes used in the sound track still it lends to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and forbidding world of the krellthe special effects are also quite arresting i recall my fear as a youngster waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible id monster and when it is finally visualized in the one battle scene it literally shook me to my toes in wonder and awe the magic of matte art is fully exploited in the dizzying scenes of the krell scientific complex as the characters make their way through the various labyrinths and passageways guided by the enigmatic dr morbiusi recall feeling some measure of jealously that dr morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of robby the robot the persona of robby is quite charming and in some ways he seems more human than some of the other characters viewers of follow on shows like twilight zone and lost in space will recognize the recycled robby prop in some of those episodes although i recall he never had the personality of the original robbyi must admit to not fully understanding the complexities of the plot until i was old enough to understand the various references to freudian psychology and the danger of unleashing the hidden and normally contained fears and rage we carry within but have trained ourselves through force of will to submerge and control through adherence to societal codes although the key to the story seems obvious once revealed it remains unknown or perhaps deliberately overlooked by dr morbius until pointed out by the clear thinking commander adams who forces dr morbius to confront the evil within himself it still gives me goose bumps when commander adams pushes dr morbius down before the krell machine that endowed him with superior intellect which opened the flood gates of his subconscious to the power of the krell machine here here is where your mind was artificially enlarged consciously it still lacked the power to operate the great machine but your subconscious had been made strong enough zoweeforbidden planet remains probably my favorite sci fi film ever and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and wonderful visualization and realization on the screen,positive

so i give it one star for true quality but id give it an eight and a half for sheer enjoyability an incredibly strange hybrid of sex comedy and vigilante thriller young warriors is just the sort of bad movie you usually hope to find when poking around the video fringe yet so rarely do it starts off with about half an hour of wacky hi jinx sex jokes and juvenile shenanigans including an olive in the martini joke that has to be seen not to be believed then the main characters younger sister gets gang raped by a bunch of swarthy bikers an objectionable scene that keeps me from giving this a for entertainment value rape is not entertainment and the main character gets the rest of his sex crazed frat brothers to help him in a quest to clean up the city find the responsible bikers and kill anybody slightly criminal they run into along the wayits hilarious non stop fun apart from the very unpleasant rape scene and is essential viewing to any serious bad movie fan trust me ive put my time in on these things and this is one of the best highlights include a wonderful visit to the library a great flickering slo mo shootout in a sleazy bar with a shot of a guy blowing his own foot off thats pretty impressive a couple of decent slumming actors richard roundtree ernest borgnine a couple of semi famous recognizable faces lynda day george scream queen linnea quigley and a couple of relatives of famous people chuck norris brother mike van patten clan member james it even has one of those great what have we become type morality lesson endings although the turning point comes when the vigilante fratboys gun down a couple of kids robbing a store with a toy gun ive always wondered why that was the catalyst that got the hero thinking after all whether they were kids and not hardened criminals and whether they had a real gun or not they were in fact still robbing a store so as far as i can tell it was just another job well done for our vigilante frat boys right wonderful stuff highly recommended just dont blame me when you enjoy it despite yourself,negative
this early pia zadora vehicle followed a familiar harold robbins formula ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world in this case the movie industry but despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable zadora to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable never convinces as a screenwriter one would expect a movie about movie making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process but the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters observance skill with words a love hate relationship with ones own creative abilities her character is as empty as a donut hole and this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here the cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening and the scenes never really hang together so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad hollywood parties avoid,negative
make no mistake maureen osullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous she is visually stunning that aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film this is a great film it not only has the classic tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie historyand these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted however the africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such in fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters the finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie the great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction if i left anything out it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who havent seen it but it is everything you could want in a movie,positive

this film is about a young mans painful journey to discovering his sexualitythe film is raw and unpretentious it does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract the viewers though the plot may seem incoherent and disconnected at times and some events are not properly explained i can understand it though because this film is a collection of memories that are highly personal to the director the subplot of about his sister and mother probably does not need to exist in the film but i can certainly imagine that these are very important events in his lifethe low budget of the film is clearly discernible it is a pity that the sound effects are poorly done the narration and some dialogs particularly the scene in the classroom with the french teacher have so much echo which makes it hard to make out what is said the ambient noise notable traffic noise is also captured throughout the film when a scene cuts into another the level of traffic noise changesthis film is probably not entertaining but it certainly serves as an insightful diary of a young mans journey to embracing his sexuality,negative
ok before i get into this lets go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of sleaze there are movies out there that can definitely out shock or out disgust this movie that have way more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film so what makes it so sleazy lets take a closer look at wet wilderness for a momentmade in for practically nothing this roughie has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by a fat dude in a ski mask wielding a machete looking for kicksthe kind that end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by the masked creep so those sensitive to themes dealing with incest are encouraged to look elsewhere then to really either add a level of surrealism or just demonstrate a complete ineptness for the art of film making the daughter of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude tied to a tree branch that fat sum bitch left me here for days with virtually no explanation whatsoever he is savedor is he of course not they are caught before they can escape where our killer forces them to have sex as well while forcing the mother to join in ending up with a dead black dude courtesy of a hatchet through the chest when all is said and done then our killer forces the daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs the macheteand the movie abruptly ends just like that no warning no tied up loose endsits simply over now there might be a proper ending to this film i honestly do not know but i have only seen the extremely crude alpha blue archives version their version appears to have the ending either cut out completely or this is how it ends if this was intentional then in film making im sure there is some sort of rule of thumb on how to end a film but it shouldnt be done like this fans of the film psycho should rejoice upon hearing the soundtrack music as its all through the film id be willing to bet no rights were licensed or anything also even though this is a violent film theres not a hell of a lot of it so gorehounds will find nothing of real use here none of the violence is graphically shownonly the results one of the victims gets stabbed with a machete right above the vagina area also the sex is some of the ugliest sex ive ever seen the interesting thing about this film is its too ugly a film to work as an effectively erotic porno or turn on anyone but those with a tendency to like things sleazy nasty and ugly but not violent enough to garner any real notoriety with those looking for something really brutal like cannibal holocaust or other flicks like that the only notorious thing about this steaming pile is that violence was added to an adult film a fairly new concept at that time especially when you consider than porn chic was all the rage and the grindhouses that filled nd street played stuff like this to a most jaded group of porn mavens this wasnt and isnt mainstream porn at allif you were in film making school and there was a list of movie making donts this film would be a shining example of that lesson this cinematic swill demonstrates what happens when cerebrally challenged filmmakers are given a budget in this case probably about cuz it looks it and ignore all the donts and turn them into dosyes this film is that bad one more thing those who get offended by racial epithets are also encouraged to watch something else the black man in the film is constantly being verbally abused about his color and the killer is obviously racist but there was no political correctness in the early s im not sure a film like this could be made todayto be honest this wont shock anyone or titillate anyone but those who get off on ugliness actually i got bored the sex is so ugly and mundane its hard to watch with any sense of eroticism so if you chance this you will thank god for the fast forward button the acting if you want to call it that is amateurish at best i mean its even bad for porno with not one reason to care about anyone or anything in this if you just gotta see this anyway then download it as youll really feel like a heel if you buy this some things are simply that worthlessand wet wildernes is the only thing more unpleasant than watching this film would be watching this film sitting in a theater and looking around at the others in attendance watching it too and suddenly feeling unsafe probably not societys greatest collection of thinkers and intellectuals but if youre up for some stupid yet sleazy porn garbage give it a crack its minutes and yet it feels much longer crackheads would love this then again maybe theres something wrong with me for seeking this out in the first placelol caveat emptor sleaze lovers,negative
this is the official sequel to the sci fi action thriller in the original van damme was among several dead vietnam war vets revived to be the perfect soldiers unisols in this one its i guess about a dozen years later since van damme has a daughter about that age now hes working with the government in a classified installation to train the latest unisols codenamed unisol for some reason as usual something goes wrong the on site super computer named seth like the snake in king cobra the same year goes power crazy takes command of the unisols and even downloads its computer brain into a new super unisol body jai white were lookin at the next step in evolution folks most of van dammes fights are with one particularly mean unisol pro wrestler goldberg who just keeps on comin drop him off a building no good run him down with a truck no go shoot him burn him forgetaboutit much of the humor is traced to how van damme is now outmoded and out classedhes even going grey around the edges but though he takes a lickin he keeps on kickin most sequels of this sort are pretty lame pale imitations of the originals and while this one is certainly no stroke of genius it manages to be consistently entertaining especially if youre a pro wrestling fan,negative
an hulking alien beastie crash lands on earth and soon wrecks havoc upon the populace first using his laser ray gun to dissolve into dust almost every human he catches sight off that is when his aim isnt terribly off and later his bare claws with which he likes to rip out and eat human spleen all in all its pretty silly stuff i do have to give it some points for being somewhat fun at times i actually enjoyed the mindless ray gun battle at the beginning and some of the later over the top gore effects however it doesnt help when the monster provides the movies only truly entertaining moments and he isnt on screen for a large portion of the films running time the acting throughout this is just plain awful and amateurish and our lead hero sheriff cinder is much too unattractive to be bagging the films hottest chick i also have to take off points for blatantly copying the thing from another world on several occasions when the monster isnt on a rampage nightbeast is far too dull and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun watch this one back to back with the thing and see the difference characterization attention to plot and detail and creating suspense makes to a monster on the loose movie,negative
this is an utterly forgettable picture a friend of mine picked it up in a bargain bin at a local rental place for he should have demanded a refund or at least a discountthe plot is something like this a giant monster threatens the earth and aliens decide that the most average human being on the planet must be chosen to save the earth thus a tiny holographic space alien appears before a postal worker and tells him that hes itthe devil is in the details when its time to rate a movie and on that count zarkorr the invader fails miserably the monster zarkorr only has a few brief moments on the screen totaling maybe minutes tops with a generous estimate the cute alien hologram has even less screen time and might be the most interesting character to look at and only because shes wearing a teeny bopper stereotype outfit complete with a teasingly short pleated skirt the climactic final battle with the monster is over before you can say whiskey tango foxtrot over in the next moment you are left to ponder whether youve just experienced a train wreck or if someone just drained pints of blood out of youadmittedly though this movie did deliver one line that my friends and i to this day still repeat and laugh at and was about the only bright spot in this otherwise abysmal picture as the cast of protagonists is being interrogated by the fuzz one of them responds to the questions with the statement what are you some kind of a question asker it is delivered in such a preposterous manner that if youre sitting with a group of friends who wont be your friends long if you actually talked your friend into watching this you may actually experience a howl or two of incredulous laughterwhile this is no manos or eegah its not even bad enough to be classically bad this movie will still bore you with its awful dialog unimaginative characters and nonexistent special effects and still deserves to inhabit the bottom,negative
eve is an eye opener because of the great sceneries and the tech no music in the backgrounds we hear this movie shows a good aspect on the human body being gods creation and to considerate about it viewers can earn better respect on the legendary story of adam and eve either if its true or just a fairy tale depending on what we believe from watching this movie actress model inger ebeltofts impersonation of eve is so good theres no good word to describe her performance and i cant imagine having another actress being eve this movie to me comes in really handy for the type of therapy of stress relief wed never fell so relax then before from watching this movie this movie is a masterpiece god supposedly wanted this movie to be made in the first placemr razbin,positive
even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group i really enjoyed this movie its a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star i know it was mine to be sure the first minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it i loved the relationship between jd and jane it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other the soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well i also liked the family set up for jane her sisters seemed lovely very well made film,positive

ive seen some bible based trash this one tops it all to make matters worse it lasts about three hours a horrible waste of time unless you want to match your kids biblical knowledge against the innumerable aberrations do yourself a favor take a walk in the sahara instead since i am required to give you a ten line statement of why not to watch this movie let me just say there is absolutely no redeemable quality to it gods conversations with noah are ridiculous the whole thing has a stench of lets make the biblical account look retarded the basic logic goes if they spent the money on a biblical film why not make it worthwhile since the basic logic is not met something is amiss the movie starts with a disclaimer about poetic licenses takenthat is the understatement of the century poetic rape but then poetic would be an unmerited favor,negative
i understand this movie was made on a very low budget but that is no excuse for the monstrosity that is grendel deathstalker the throne of fire barbarian queen conquest the invincible barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects yet they still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor the primitive costumes dark castles and beautiful bulgarian landscape gave grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film but the makers completely ruined this opportunity by using extremely poor cgi effects and colorless characters compare this film to beowulf it may not be citizen kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci fi adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters,negative

the first half hour or so of this movie i liked the obvious budding romance between ingrid bergman and mel ferrer was cute to watch and i wanted to see the inevitable happen between them however once the action switched to the home of ingrids fiancé it all completely fell apart instead of romance and charm we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film the fiancés boorish son and the military attachés vying for the maids attention looked stupid sort of like a subplot from an old love boat episode how the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me this film is an obvious attempt by renoir to recapture the success he had with the rules of the game as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate just as in the other film i was not a huge fan of the rules of the game but elena and her men had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film,negative

this may not be the worst comedy of all time but its close the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life and i want it backchris kattan is funny for about minutes his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse he falls into a long line of former snl ers that have attempted movies some have been brilliant some have failed miserably theres not much middle ground in this category although chris farley was brilliant and then okay and then not so funny and then deadso i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one careeravoid this movie like the plaguec,negative
this movie is hilarious the laughs never stop every scene is packed to the limit with hilarious comedy chris farley is a comic genius and spade plays his character to a tee farley was one of the best slap stick comics ever and in this movieas with all his movies we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character the way he saw fit tommy boy is an excellent example of a comedy it always makes me laugh no matter how many times i have seen it before,positive
this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it to make little like it which made it even stupider even some of the names were unrealistic the film is fun to watch which is why it had out of stars this is probably the rd stupidest movie ever made i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie the most upsetting one was danny trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty the other actors were pretty much clean as far as im concerned,negative
in all honesty if someone told me the director of lemony snickets series of unfortunate events city of angels and caspers was going to do a neat little low budget indie film and thatd it be real good id say that person must be joking but thats what director brad siberling did and it was really good items or less has a similar conceit to films like before sunrise lost in translation or more recently once it involves the chance meeting of two people who if serendipity didnt put them there theyd probably never cross paths or if they did they wouldnt say word one to each other like those films items or less focuses on the relationship that builds and how the characters come to understand each other and build on each others strengths and weaknessesthe story involves morgan freeman playing an unnamed actor who goes to research his role as a grocery store employee for an upcoming independent movie and because of things beyond his control ends up spending the day with the lady in the items or less lane played by paz vega she has a rotten marriage and is hoping to land a new job as a secretary initially freemans character just needs a lift home after spending time with her however he wants to get to know her and maybe even offer her some advicebrad siberling builds the characters almost entirely through the exchanges between freeman and vega the plot is merely a setup for these two characters to interact with each other for most of the films minute duration freeman has fun with his character as he appears an outsider in lower class world that vegas character scarlett inhabits vega in the meantime grows beyond the stubborn checkout clerk upset with her lifes situation looking to move onthere a couple things that really stood out in this film first of all siberling has probably taken note from independent cinema to make sure the relationship is sincere and doesnt fall into any hollywood pitfalls its a very mutual friendship that develops convincingly throughout the film it works even though the situation itself does seem a little inconceivablei am also impressed with the performances while freemans presence gives this film credibility from the get go he shows a certain amount of charm and fun not usually seen from him paz vega meanwhile is priming herself for a breakthrough in us film sometime in the future i loved her in spanglish and shes equally good here as the tough no nonsense scarlet towards the end of the film she successfully conveys the growth of her character im looking forward to seeing her in more filmsoverall items of less functions best as a character piece well scripted and directed by brad siberling he hasnt done much writing and his feature film work has consisted mostly of big hollywood films yet theres certainly an artist at work here and am anxious to see if hell take this road again,positive
loki norse god of mischief creates a mask that endows the wearer with cartoon like powers at the command of his father odin he spends the rest of the movie looking for the mask so that it can cause no further grief to mankind in the meantime the possessor of the mask conceives a child who inherits the powers of the mask etc etc if this sounds like a pretty thin plot line it is add to this the fact that the movie is handled ineptly from start to finish and the result is very very bad you can find worse movies but youll have to actively search for themfor the most part son of the mask is presented at the intellectual level of a pre schooler but in light of scenes such as the mask baby urinating copiously in six different directions including on his father this premise seems unlikely i asked my son who he thought might have been the target audience for the movie and he responded convicted felons apparently forgetting for the moment that the constitution prohibits cruel and unusual punishmentbut just making a bad movie is not a sin or hell would be overflowing what makes it a sin is that million was spent on this piece of garbage to put things in perspective the day after we watched son of the mask my son and i watched good night and good luck a movie that garnered six academy award nominations including best picture and was brought in for million thats right just one tenth of the amount of money spent on son of the mask this then is the sin to flush good money down the sewer when it could have been better used in making watchable movies or feeding starving children or for that matter almost any other purpose the producers should truly be ashamed of themselves,negative
only saw this show a few times but will live in my memory it is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like friends especially even more difficult to obtain being in england i guessthey say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the bakersfield pd themselves maybe it was just too clever for certain people anyhow just about the one comedy i would love to see again but is almost impossible to find i hear it is being or has been repeated on another network but alas not over heresummary ingenious,positive
crossfire is one of those films from the forties that is crying for a remake if for no other reason than maybe its time it should be done as originally written the story on which the film is based is about the killing of a gay man but anti semitism was certainly a hot topic in the days of post world war ii with the holocaust fresh in everyones mindin the lee server biography of robert mitchum edward dmytryk the director was interviewed and and bluntly said that the film could never have been made about a hate crime against gays at the time with the code firmly in place it could have been though because the character of robert ryan is such an equal opportunity hater of everything that deviates from his societal normsmitchum was told in no uncertain terms that he was in the film strictly for the ride robert young was cast as the washington dc police homicide captain who catches the case and while mitchum was second billed he knew from the beginning the film would belong to ryan but he was rkos new star by dint of his performances in the story of gi joe and till the end of time so he was there for box office insurance mitchums part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case george coopercrossfire is not a whodunit even though we dont see the crime it becomes clear that montgomery is the one who kills sam levene the quintessential jewish salesperson and it becomes clear to young and mitchum that ryan is the guilty party almost as fast as it does to the audience it becomes just a question of getting the evidenceryan earned one of several academy award nominations the film garnered his best supporting actor category though he lost to edmund gwenn the film was ryans breakthrough role similarly gloria grahame was nominated for a brief part as a party girl for best supporting actress but she lost to celeste holm for gentlemans agreement in fact crossfire ran up against gentlemans agreement and lost for best picture and best director for dmytryk to elia kazan its fifth nomination for best screenplay and crossfire came up short again with the winner being miracle on th streetgloria grahame also had her own problems on the set which spilled over from her personal life she was having big trouble with her then husband stanley clements who was an abusive husband he was hanging around the set causing ed dmytryk a lot of problems fortunately grahames part was a small one in fact the whole film was shot in typical rko economy style in daysrobert young has a particularly fine scene with william phipps a young kid from tennessee in mitchum and ryans outfit who ryan constantly belittles young is most eloquent in speaking about the corrosive nature of hate and how it affected his family as irish catholics who came over in the potato famine years it was one of robert youngs best moments on screen in his long careeras fine a film as crossfire is its time to be remade as a story about an anti gay hate crime especially with the real killing of barry winchell from the last decade and the debate about gays in the militarythats a film whos time has come and almost gone,positive
this is a pretty obscure dumb horror movie set in the s everglades it is really stupid and lame for the first half then it actually starts to get good for the last half there is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing i dont know it is mesmerizing i was impressed with the night time scenes because it actually looked like night unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime i feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule there are a few scenes towards the end the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool this movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its scooby doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat i was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be i couldnt take my eyes off of it and i had to ask myself why,positive
after gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex rental dvds i figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than sam mendes for a number of reasons american beauty doesnt appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that tom hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade for this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins and is simply wonderful to watch because of it and despite my usual allergy to any film with tom hanks name on it still cant watch big without wanting a cat to kick im glad i gave this a try because this is one of those movies that youll kick yourself for if you miss itnormally squeaky clean hanks plays michael sullivan a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during prohibition in the early s he is also a professional hit man to mob boss john rooney paul newman but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons but after his eldest tyler hoechlin witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing the pair are forced to go on the run as john seeks to tidy the matter up soon father and son are pursued to chicago where a fellow hit man a menacing jude law is waiting for themon the face of it it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as ive said this isnt really about gangsters at all its about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances hanks is grits teeth superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little hoechlin is also good as sullivans son in all honesty there is not a single performance that i could single out as weaker than the others the cast is pretty much faultless as is the cinematography and costumes and its not often i praise costumes which recreates the s with stunning effect there has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades this could easily have looked rubbish they admit that the early s look was difficult to put down but it doesnt and that deserves every bit of credit chicago especially looks fantastic lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats true time travel even if a little cgi is neededthe story is also a winner offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer maguire and proves that you dont have to be cagney or de niro or brando to play a gangster the film is decidedly noir ish driving rain and ill lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are finally seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts the whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the tommy gun shootouts and extortion rackets it can feel a little slow in places especially if youre used to masses of gun play in movies like most modern audiences like yours truly but sometimes words can speak louder than actions mendes has delivered a fine follow up to his oscar winning debut a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch road to perdition may not be to everyones tastes but this is one dvd i shall not be exchanging anytime soon,positive

i saw shiner on dvd while i was watching it i thought this is a really bad porn flick without the porn i also thought whoever wrote this has some real issues then i watched the director writer carlson explain his process as a special feature yeah it was real specialthe emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off they are marginally attractive there is frontal and full nudity these factors probably account for the film being seen at allthe most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants the two drunken losers not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view but the acting is horrendously badthen theres the boxer stalker theme this is really insane not just absurd this hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy mommas boy who works at his gyms parking lot this is in la mind you the boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalkers house strips in front of him and gets excited in the processwell all i can say is why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker it simply makes no sense and im afraid some psycho dynamics actually do make sense if you take the time to read about them however bad scripts seldom make sense at allthe director writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community well he may be correct i suppose we may never know since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or dvd store the only two places they could possibly find this turkey thank goodness for that,negative

dominick nicky luciano wears a hulk t shirt and trudges off everyday to perform his duties as a garbage man he uses his physical power in picking up others trash and hauling it to the town dump he reads comic book hero stories and loves wrestlers and wrestling going to wrestlemania with his twin brother eugene on their birthday is a yearly tradition he talks kindly with the many people he comes in contact with during his day he reads comic books which he finds in the trash with a young boy who he often passes by while on the garbage route unfortunately dominick has a diminished ability to use his mind he has a disabilitydominicks disability came as a result of an injury to the head in which he suffered traumatic brain injury tbi this injury left him slower though it did not change his core characteristic as a strong individual who helps to protect others dominick is actually more able to live independently than he may seem at the beginning of the film he lives with eugene who is studying to become a doctor dominick provides the main source of income while eugene is off studying eugene must face the fact that he is to continue his education in a different city and that he must move away from dominick eugene also develops a romance which begins to separate him from his twin brotherthe film deals specifically with domestic abuse and how this can impact individuals families and then society as a whole the strain that escalates between eugene and dominick as eugene realizes that he must eventually leave nicky exploded on their birthday night eugene yells at dominick and throws him against the wall in this moment eugene must confront his own fears of being like his abusive father the father which dominick protected him against while he himself became the victim of the abuse this event cemented the love between the two brothers who from then on became the best of friends though they needed each other they also both needed independence and the ability to grow and develop relationship with others the fact that they must part ways became a very real emotional strain however by the end of the film dominick is able to say good bye to his brother and wish him luck eugene is able to leave his brother with the confidence that he has started to make a social network of people who care about him and will help him with his independencewhen dominick witnesses the abuse of his friend he is forced to come face to face with the cause of his own trauma in this state of extreme stress dominick almost completely shuts down he then runs after the ambulance to the hospital to see what happened to his friend after learning that the boy has died he is confronted by the abusive father who fearing his testimonial tells him he didnt see nothing doesnt know anything and not to say anything and that if he does he will kill him now that his own life has been threatened he goes and find the hand gun that larry used to kill the rats he goes to the wake of the deceased boy and at gunpoint kidnaps the baby of the grieving family he runs away from the scene and hides in a building when the police surround him eugene goes in the building to talk to his brother eugene then reveals the cause of dominicks disability and they bring the baby back the abusive father then wields a gun of his own threatening to kill dominick but eugene stops him and dominick tells the crowd that he saw the father throw his son down the stairsthrough the climactic ending the issue of dysfunctional behavior comes into view though dominicks instinct to save the baby can be understood we also see how damaging this response is dominick put the babys life and his own life in grave danger the larger societal consequences of these events is not directly implicated but rather shown through the films ending despite the more optimistic ending portrayal another sequence of events might just have likely occurred in which dominick is charged with kidnapping and possession of a firearm it is somewhat difficult to believe that this went completely unaccounted furthermore even if dominick is not charged there may still be a stigma against him within the community not that there wasnt one before these events instead the film shows that we must be able to recognize problematic behavior and act to curb itdominick and eugene was released in the same year as another film rainman which won academy awards while rainman was an achievement and helped increase the visibility with person with disabilities it could be argued that dominick and eugene holds more valuable lessons for society whereas rainman demonstrated that mainstream american society might be able to learn from and care for a savant if the savant is the inheritor of a large estate dominick and eugene show that a person with a disability might be able to care for and help save members of american society the message of an independent person with disabilities may have been too strong for hopefully someday society will see the strengths of individuals with disabilities not as a threat but as imperative for the strength of society,positive

i recently bought this movie on dvd at a discount store for although it is a no frills dvd on the geneon label just the movie that starts playing immediately no menu no special features the picture and sound quality were excellent the movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in historyrichard jordan who i must admit to not having heard of plays the lead pinky green a charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so he portrays an american in england david niven plays the lead bad guy also with the great charm for which he is famous bad but with scruples as when he refuses to deny pinky his whack for the job whack in england apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in american gangster films all the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable moviewhat is perhaps best to me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable i frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters without any special effects no blood no violence not even a single car chase just a well written story well acted well directed and well photographed if i had any complaints about the movie i would question the music what is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in england,positive
many people remember the waco standoff that occurred a long time ago what most people probably have ingrained in their minds is the cult leader david koresh and the images of the compound burning to the ground after a long standoff a lot of people have the belief that koresh was some kind of madman who thought he was god he was accused of being a child molester and was credited for the breakdown and deaths of his followers furthermore many people feel the cult committed mass suicide when the fbi stormed mount carmel center and when the building was burning most people feel the cult was at fault for not agreeing with the fbi on reasonable terms most people feel the cult was brainwashed by koresh and followed along with everything that he said nothing could be farther from the truth because of strong evidence after the nightmare was over and this one of a kind documentary pretty much proves it this documentary is one of the most balanced examinations at the situation that occurred it is much more thorough and highly detailed than anything most people have received in the mainstream media to the shock of many people this documentary will reveal that is was the atf the fbi and the higher levels of the united states government who were the ones who were unjust cruel and deceptive and not david koresh and his followers what korseh and davidians were doing was just protecting their constitutional rights and the higher powers completely violated and raped those rights the aft had no grounds to storm the compound it was the aft that shot first and they shot from the helicopters from above at unarmed men women and children what is even more shocking is the actions of the fbi when they entered the mount carmel watch it for yourselves and you will develop and new perspective on the us government there is infrared footage that clearly shows the fbi was shooting with machine guns at the men women and children in the burning compound it will make your blood boil it will make you really angry it will make you wonder as to what kind of people run this country finally it will make you wonder as to what you are being told on the news every night is the whole truth and nothing but the truth this video is frightening and i highly recommend it if one can find it this documentary does not need to be purchased it can be watched for free on google video,positive
til there was you is one of the worst films weve ever seen it fails in every respect jeanne tripplehorn was better as an actress in waterworld in comparison this film is dungworld when a character stumbles once or even twice in the course of a film one can understand it but jeannes character falls trips stumbles so often that she might have a bit of jerry lewis in her in her defence each prat fall was probably blocked choreographed and rehearsed and rehearsed although this is bad enough for a film the actors dylan mcdermott and jeanne tripplehorn seem to spend most of the plot going out for a smoke or trying to find a place to smoke if the film was a diatribe on having no place to smoke ok but it isnthowever long this film runs it is too long by minutes past the running timeoh jeanne tripplehorn almost acts in a public forum meeting you almost see her break life into the character oh its almost as convincing as her scene yelling at michael douglas in basic instinct hmm on second thought not reallythis is a film to avoid at all costs unless you need a cigarette and are trapped in nicotine addicts anonymous or forced to watch outtakes of hooper burt reynolds and even then toss a coin or go to sleep,negative

this aussie flick filmed in does an ok job of portraying a bunch of small time crooks in kings cross sydney the plot focuses on the plight of a young would be crim whos life is in danger after botching a job for his future boss very well acted by heath ledger and bryan brown the plot is fairly believable with some very humorous moments in one scene which revolves around a bank heist the setting up of various themes central to the story is quite well done eg when one crim is searching for bullets for his gun i personally have a dislike for gratuitous violence in movies and in this regard the movie did not offend it attempted and succeeded in showing us the human side of the baddies such as bryan brown the rest of the cast did an ok job without any real stand outs that i remember the direction was very good in succeeding in making a believable movie that provided good entertainment the main overriding feature that makes this a good movie is the acting and direction of heath ledger and his successful portrayal of a naive young man who makes stupid mistakes for short term gratification thinking he is indestructible and not realizing that there are sinister people waiting to pounce on any mistake the director gregor jordan deserves special mention rating in my book of,positive
i watched this with great trepidation and my trepidation was well founded it seems what was this movie about knight the season the players what it was all over the place all the time it had no tension sorry we all knew bobby was going to curse and throw things but brian denehy a fine actor comes across as mailing in the anger and delivering zero tension cheaply shot like a macgiver episode contrast this thanksgiving main course with the job hbo did on the don king movie only in america to show how to do sports biopics warts and all notice that espn promoted the hell out of it and then never showed it again,negative

theres so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin en la mente del asesino inside the killers mind that its very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning lets just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done its made with super black and white shots milimeters color interviews flashbacks aro tolbukhin its like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the moviefor the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aros mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into aros childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boringi dont mean and dont want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy,positive

while my kids enjoyed the movie and announced afterward that they want to buy it later i think i got more out of it that they did the scene in the airport shop at the beginning is real life i did not use the cutting comment aloud but i thought it it is a feel good mid life movie a bit sappy and some scenes work less well than others why does the kid stay with bruce willis after he knows his mom is dying but all in all and good time it also gave our family something to talk about did my kids think my life was boring what do they expect at how can you not like a movie that gets a good conversation going with your kids,positive

yes georgio is a light hearted and enjoyable movie comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music its not my favorite movie but it is a movie i have enjoyed seeing more than once some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera dvd although a full opera might be a better representation of pavarottis operatic talents oftentimes an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person yes georgio permits pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would notmany reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable i dont agree enormously talented people can be both self centered and charming charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own both georgio and pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the otherrelax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities the ending scenes from puccinis turandot alone are worth the time to get there,positive
just re saw this movie after thirty seven years i was eleven years old and caught this flick on south beach at the long gone cinema theater on washington avenue in i thought where its at was a very good movie now however after almost forty years its not as good as it was times have changed and this movie is now a tired old re hash of the war between the generations it did however catch a place in time which is just a memory its really interesting to see the mod fashions the old vegas a slim don rickles chain smoking and a hip opening song the acting was decent the script somewhat out dated but the memories were still fresh where its at may not be where its at for you but for me it was still a nice and entertaining trip down memory lane,positive
i think that the costumes were excellent and the hairdressers also performed well it has the very authentic feeling for that period of timei dont know if it was the computer magic or if it was real some of the big scenes have hundreds of extras in the background i was especially impressed with the scene of that bridgethe main character the actress also performed well she showed us a nervous witty woman who knows how to use herself to seduce men to get what she wantssome of the scenes were hilarious even though it was about hours long but it was never boring a very good entertaining movie,positive

if you are looking for an erotic masterpiece this isnt it if youre looking for a comedic masterpiece this isnt it if youre looking for something hardcore this isnt itthat being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of european erotic comedy from the the early mid s this is iti see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness they are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking german and anyone who speaks any german will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with syllablesif you have seen the dvd prior to the latest release it is marketed with covers of s and recently s adult stars the film is an r film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this the film is edited from the original but it was also edited prior to its run in the drive ins in the late si first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on cinemax many people become upset when later in life it doesnt live up to their previous memories its understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays eroticaif you compare to a modern soft core erotic comedy you may be disappointed the film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle if you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed compared to today you see very littleit is still one of the best examples along with bottoms up and the other cinderella of european erotic comedic cinema of the s,positive
i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads gérard philippe and michle morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of distasteful charactersindeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters the doctor is of course the major exception what michle morgan ever sees in philippe to fall in love with him is never explainedthis is supposedly based on a work by jean paul sartre all i could think was that if sartres work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating camus masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africaa well acted but uninteresting movie,negative

though not a greek i have had a lifelong interest in the eastern empire its fall in was the greatest loss to christianity in its entire history yet while the easter empire is not a topic much discussed in american intellectual circles the us did not merely mimic golden byzantiums public architecture the us is much absorbed in the fated byzantine historical cycle and now has faced many of the crises involving certain people of a middle eastern extraction about whom it is said that there is a slight tendency for excessive exuberance on religious matters which humbled great byzantium i wonder if the loss of the ability to speak plainly was the first sign post on the road to disasterjohn romer is to be credited not only for his excellent production but also for his joyful enthusiasm for the subject which is most refreshingnot recommended for americans who like political correctness,positive
the merchant of venice this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plotas a film version of the famous shakespeare play merchant of venice does what few adaptations have done since polanskis rather gritty macbeth it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as but better than the play alone could readily achieve lord of the rings director peter jackson has argued that in adapting a book or play there are three options attempt to replicate the original as perfectly as possible use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change or the one he avowedly preferred stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally viable but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the originalin macbeth polanski used the rain sodden beaches and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill advised decisions it differs from say branaghs hamlet which achieved new heights of faithful rendition but otherwise offered little new macbeth on the other hand maybe enabled audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the dramas fullness without extensive study similarly more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the unaided stage performance could accomplish such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points shakespeare wanted to makeradfords adaptation of merchant of venice does just this it takes crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or the keeping promises and with minimal messing of the bards holy tome conveys them faithfully within the spirit of the original storythe first of these religious bigotry gives meaning to shylocks otherwise outlandish behaviour we see the jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap not being allowed to own property one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money lending this makes them both useful to their christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their vilification the idea behind both old and new testament biblical prohibitions against usury probably stems from not making a profit by helping ones friends this is extended by the bigoted christians to curse those they spit on we see shylock not only spit on but fellow jews thrown into the waterways for sport in an atmosphere that can only be described as threateningthe topicality of the film is curious since the bigotry of right wing christianity as personified by bush following americans has turned full circle as they are now the main supporters of zionism and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as shylock tries to bite at antonio once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so the psychology is self evident kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious the circle easily continues as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become oppressorsthe stringent sleight of hand that the disguised portia uses to save antonio has some merit both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the venetians of the play so rue and also as a moral pointer shylock may have his pound of flesh according to his contract but may not have any blood an easy analogy could be made as far as warfare and terrorism goes it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking ill doers if soldiers or evil doers are the only victims when there is massive collateral damage as when innocent citizens including women and children are killed in their hundreds the warmongers arguments whether those warmongers be israeli palestinian or us american carry far less popular support there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti semitic in this story one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people far from teaching him a greater good the ending enforces christianity and humiliation upon shylock a course likely simply to perpetuate pent up resentment both camps look just as bad one simply holds more power than the other the slight amelioration of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image or as bassanio so acutely observes when choosing the caskets and solving the riddles to win portias handin religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward partsof course the bigotry applies to organised religion rather than spirituality especially when organised for political purposes but one that easily goads ordinary god fearing people who are not in the habit of splitting hairs the kindness mercy chesed in judaism which is so fundamental to true christianity is something also practiced to a wonderful degree in judaism as in most creeds the jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part of ones being rather than just an outward show both shylock and antonio are bigoted and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith while shakespeare maybe pointed up the chasm between the goodness prescribed by different faiths and its absence in practice the film version reduces much of the window for interpretations of anti semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causesthe keeping of promises the men to their wives is dealt with less well as are the comic elements inherent in the cross dressing sub plots bassanio however strong his love for antonio are there homosexual elements there cannot make sound moral judgements when showing his gratitude to the judge and so breaks his promise for which portia forgives him displaying a triumphal character for women not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts including her husbandsome of the acting is a bit stilted and there are too many regional english accents but on the whole merchant of venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of shakespeare i enjoyed the acting and also the very beautiful soundtrack by hayley westenra and others singing ballads penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe all in all merchant of venice is a not inconsiderable achievement of british as far as any film can be said to be of a particular nationality these days cinematic tradition,positive
i already loved how the grinch stole christmas when it was released and im still loving it now years later still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came outsure the movie is over the top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch all of the sets costumes and characters are done perfectly over the top in a fun way without ever becoming truly ridicules its a visually spectacular movie to watch its a campy movie making at its very best director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas moviemain reason why the movie works and why its so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role he is of course helped by the convincing make up which also received an academy award of course if youre a jim carrey hater you shouldnt even think about watching this movie this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinchthe movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me perhaps its because im dutch and we dont really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here as in the united states or england for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honestthe musical score by james horner is good and fun even though its your average every day horner stuff it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scenes workperfect christmas entertainment,positive

what can be said really the tenant is a first class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full blown paranoia its an intricately plotted film every detail seems included for a reason even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable trelkovsky polanski a meek polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenants suicide to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty after an apartment warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfuk on par with the later efforts of david lynch the tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score its a movie thats better experienced than described so hop to it,positive
with all the dreck out there this is a gentle movie about young love yes its true that young love often makes more out of something than it deserves but why arent people down on romeo and juliet paul and michelle are models of good behave compared to themyes they run away and set up an ideal life but this is a movie not real life paul is more sexually interested than michelle who has been come onto in a bad way eventually they have sex but no one is forced into it the movie does let kids know that sex can cause babiesone thing there is nudity in the movies the camera does not focus on it but it is therethe ending of the movie has paul in good chance of being found out in paul and michelle they separate for a time if you dont like the ending of a movie think one up yourself alternative endings are not just for dvds,positive

this was an excellent film i dont understand why so many people dont like it there was so much in it to connect with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that werent said i was thoroughly entertained and was left with a feeling of joyous exuberance just as i am when i finish most any tom robbins story now i havent read this particular book of robbins so i dont now how this matched up but i cant imagine this movie could have been a very bad interpretation the movie left a lot for you to define yourself which is the best part of any tom robbins novel dreaming up the details to all of you who said this was the worst movie ever i pity what little must be left of the dimming light in your hearts far from the worst ever this movie was glorious long live the whooping crane,positive
following my experience of finland for slightly more than a week id say this movie depicts the nature of the finnish society very accurately especially the young couple with a baby having serious issues phenomenon is very familiar to me as i witnessed the exact same thing in person when i was in finland the relationships and problems of people fragility of the marriage institution the drinking culture unemployment and the ascending money problem all are very well put without any subjectivity or exaggerationthere are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and captivate the viewer i happen to think in a calm moment what is happening in the lives of all these people on the street well this is what is happening movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power it would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects finland as it is and pretty damn wellone comment about the acting being the fan of finnish cinema i am ive never seen any of these actors on any other movie but i found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew ill be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast,positive
watching the commercials for this movie i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it for one thing it was one of those loosely based on the novel movies which usually means that the book author saw the script hated it and refused to be associated with the film worse the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ex kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hoseand falls over so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the must see film of the season of course he thought the same thing about cars over the hedge the ant bully monster house etc etc i was admittedly less than thrilledbut once at the theater the film won me over for a variety of reasons first and foremost the writers capture kid dialogue better than just about any other childrens film ive ever seen a prime example of this comes directly after the boys principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet the boys do a lame over exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them which makes it realistic since all little kids think mistakenly that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors then one of the boys asks why did he say alley oop another boy responds maybe hes crazy and the entire group laughs uproariously not an overly witty rejoinder but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious as if to confirm it my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on screen i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situationanother reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying sibling relationships the new kid in school and peer pressure conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special for example the bully joe isnt stereotypical hes definitely bad but not pure evil and just enough of his home life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins theres also no cue the dramatic music moment where billy worm boy realizes what a complete tool hes being to his younger brother woody and yet by the end of the movie some type of minor transformation has been made theres some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other and very little of it comes across as cornythe only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonalds dance party in mac and me would scoff at why oh why was it put into the movie did austin rogers adam pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on the history channeloverall though this movie was excellent and the length about an hour and twenty minutes was just about perfect one of the best most realistic live action kid films youll ever see if youre ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like,positive
the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last years the characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that i love so much to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatementif you have never read the books i imagine you will enjoy the movie the acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie and the story is interesting however if you love the books avoid this movie at all costsi found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek lengle said of the film i expected it to be bad and it isi like another reviewer here feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind,negative
cecil b demilles parlor to prison tearjerker manslaughter finds the lovely leatrice joy as a good at heart but decadent young lady with more money than she knows what to do with her recklessness leads to imprisonment which in turn leads to her regeneration thomas meighan is the crusading district attorney who has made it his personal crusade to bring out the goodness and wholesomeness in lydia joy but he gets sidetracked by alcohol and once she is released it is up to her to rescue himif the plot doesnt sound too bad youll be floored by the woeful presentation the quality of demilles direction is very low and he does not show any particular skill that is unique to him the photography is standard and flat and the editing is hardly more dynamic one could easily classify it as a fashion show and be pretty correct demille gets to dress miss joy up in so many different types of clothes evening gowns golfing costumes motoring costumes piles of furs that its subtitle could be fashions of one thing more disappointing than the photography or editing or the direction is the acting which is mostly flat and wooden when it is not it is merely routine silent gesturing rolling eye balls twitching eye brows and deliberate pointing and arm movements what would have been enlivened for modern viewers by mugging and scene chewing of some of the worst silent films is here merely dull to watch the only member of the cast who succeeds in any form of excellence is lois wilson who is not only beautiful but is able to play her role naturally she is convincing and endearing in tearful close ups as long as you dont read the moralizing title card that follows once she opens her mouth to speak like i said everybody else is droningly routine joy meighan even julia faye her performance here makes a good argument for why she never attained true stardomthe worst and most amusing part of this movie is the heavy moralistic tone that carries through all of it meighans character has plenty of intertitles where he drones on about how the youth of america is declining in its moral stance and going right back to the decadence of rome insert absurd flashback this movies moralizing has been described as victorian but its further than that it has so little bearing in reality that i have a feeling audiences at that time didnt take it any more seriously than modern viewers couldthis movie is exactly what the unknowing tend to think of as a typical silent movie with its archaic moral structure wooden acting and bad direction demille shows that he could be a terrible director with no sense of pacing camera placement or skill in handling either script or actors i cant imagine anybody in their right mind taking it seriously boring slow and idiotic i recommend it to hardcore silent movie dorks like myself only,negative
i have grown up reading modesty blaise both the comics and the books and she truly is a heroine to me although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment shes worthy of i heard of my name is modesty a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here and wasnt too surprised to find out the score was not too high since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans heart if not done exactly right so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead and well i just finished watching it and im stunned and sad and yeah pretty furious too sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fanit seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and unprofessional although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i cant blame them but the screenplay and the directing my god why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse i dont know the background of this film and actually i really dont want to know but i just cant help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my nighti give this film stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which couldve been worse the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at oh well hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions im not holding my breath,negative
this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see it is painfully long and awfully directed i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end run time is way over hrs which could have been edited to less then hrstransition between stories is average most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come outits funny only in pockets ambitious project and a below par execution govinda does a fair job anil kapoor disappointed me rest we as expected if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close,negative

if you like horror or action watch this film asap if the opening scene doesnt get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse great action excellent casting and top one liners this is the only film i have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop kick punch thrown not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun its a pure rush of dark comic book action,positive
i had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie it was an epic of adolescence a dream of summers gone a great potential indie film or big budget drama it somehow got into the hands of a hack who clearly took notes watching boogie nights and rushmore without actually learning anything at all the script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags i feel sorry for the actors since the characters in the book were rich and textured but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film mason gamble is great when given the opportunity as is dylan baker but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special poor people good rich people bad though its almost worth watching to see the southern california beach where gary sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in delaware its a good book but an embarrassing turn for first time director mills goodloe k,negative
this was a wonderful little film that truly was creative and fun something you see all too seldom in movies the film begins in russia just after the fall of the communist government as a result society seems to be in chaos and life has yet to improve now that the old regime is gone dirty cities crime and lack of housing still plague the poor residents of st petersburginto this scene of bleakness and uncertainty comes an idealistic music teacher he is among those without a home and he finally gets a letter from the government that tells him he has a tiny room in a nearby flat when he arrives the place is a mess but the people seem friendly enough so they all have a lovely party in the middle of the night they are awakened by an old lady walking out of the giant wardrobe in the room i was half expecting lucy and the other kids from the lion the witch and the wardrobe to come out but they didnt they are too shocked to do anything at first but decide soon to investigate instead of just being a clothes closet the wardrobe opens into paris how the residents of the flat respond to this magical gateway is really intriguing some like the music teacher are thrilled and in awe most of the others are more pragmatic and are mostly concerned with looting everything from paris before the gateway closes once and for all these russian thieves are awful people greedy coarse and crude but down deep very deep are hearts of gold i like how this is a metaphor for the nation now on the brink of capitalism at first they run amok grabbing everything they can and only later do they reveal some depth but mostly they act much like guests on the jerry springer show the film has many twists and turns and is both funny and mesmerizing about the only negative is that due to some harsh language and a nude scene albeit a very funny one this is not a film for kids this is a real shame as with some very minor editing this could have been a great family film,positive
stella starring bette midler in the title role is an unabashed tearjerker set in upstate new york stella claire works nights as a bar maid pouring and dancing in a workingmans saloon one night in comes a slumming medical intern stephen dallas who woos stella and in the course of their affair impregnates her she spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion sends him packing to a lucrative medical career and raises her daughter herself in near poverty flash forward years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous loving young lady dr dallas is not out of the picture still maintaining a tenuous but caring relationship with his daughter and im rambling and worse yet making the movie sound somewhat interesting the acting and screenwriting are so over the top youll let out a groan in almost every scene the chief offender is bette midler but close behind is john goodman as her alcoholic buddy each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale which is truly a hoot taken as a dramatic piece this film rates no more than grade d but as camp it scores an unintended b,negative
what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no self respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda bynes talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid airhead desperate men chasing old maid wannabes is beyond metheir plots and dialog remind me of the simpons homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen everyone should ask wheres poochie all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead then they get back together or break up at the end the women are either shallow stupid or sex addicts the only word i can think of is sucks,negative
it doesnt matter whether youve experienced the plight of the elderly in america or if youre just plain clueless uncle frank and matthew ginsburg give you that clue in a straight forward funny wake up and smell the roses sort of way by the end of the film it is obvious that while being totally entertained somehow youve also been educated a terrific film by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field matthew ginsburg is a name to pay attention to,positive
i love columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot a mind bogglingly tedious pointless muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored looking peter falk the plot such as it is just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with one part of the proceedings which i found extremely puzzling or possibly annoying was peter falks character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as lt columbo if the producers insist on keeping columbos first name a secret why couldnt they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous like i said this is the pits and all true columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague,negative

what a great movie this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the s and the s i was so pleasantly surprised after the past years of absolute detritus disneys live productions crews have churned outthis movie is an absolute joy the child stars were just that professional quality actors i am most impressed with the quality of this moviesigourney weaver was a total sycophantic insert hyperbole here running a prison camp for wayward boys siobhan fallon was wonderful as the stars motheri wont recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again but the story is wonderful the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb this work reminds you what its like to be a child without going all sugary or being too grim the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it while the abuse was hinted in the finished product it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent it was best that waythis was an absolutely delightful movie to watchit gets a fromthe fiend,positive
tumbling doll of flesh aka niku daruma and psycho the snuff reels this was on my want list for quite a while and then i finally scored a copy on ebay a while back its never been on dvd and what i got from ebay was a very good quality dvd r which im quite satisfied with the movie is i believe the most extreme example of torture porn with an emphasis on porn a woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed the porn is definitely real with the annoying japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots without much success most of the time after the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots and in one of the most disgusting scenes the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest this is after both legs have been severed her arm and a few other niceities this movie outdoes the guinea pig series by a long shot in fact they are not even close to the realism although cheap gore effects shown in this movie this is indeed one of the best fake snuff films i have ever seen if not the best now i must warn you that if you are not into this stuff you should stay far far away this movie is very strong and with the real sex it is in a very sick way erotic to an extent and i mean in a very sick way but wherever you come down on this subject material this movie brings the goods home and i would definitely recommend you seek it out after reading about the movie i was expecting something very strong but it exceeded that by a bunch,positive
happy days was produced and broadcast from the mid s to the early s and seems to get more ridiculous with age at the time of its broadcast most viewers who grew up in the s were in middle age with families and the scenes at mels diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them the fonz was of course the coolest of the cool although the actor henry wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle richie cunningham was the all american blond haired kid who would probably be elected student body president potsie was richies best friend the star of the show has to have a best friend i guess and ralph malph was the bumbling sidekick to the fonz if not the entire group i loved it when the fonz would beat up on poor ralph malph and there was mel the middle aged lug who ran mels diner and of course who could forget the appearance of mork was this really the s ironically films produced during the s such as rebel without a cause and the wild one have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced years after the period it portraysunfortunately the tv show happy days is not in the same league as rebel without a cause or american graffitti for that matter happy days may have captured some aspects of the s with its burger diner juke boxes cool cars and tacky plaid shirts but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal american graffitti had something to say about young americans in the s whereas happy days seemed more about what middle aged people of the s wished the s had been like the result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the s happy days is at best a comedy fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the s as its backdrop as pointed out by another reviewer the all american kid richie cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop out like fonzie and mel would probably forbid fonzie from entering his dinera quick history happy days was originally a pilot called love in the happy days that was rejected for broadcast comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show love american style which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and or alterations in short love american style was a throw away show that contained all these one episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut love in the happy days did appear as a love american style show sometime in the early s but at the time tv executives could not foresee how a show about s young people would be popular particularly during the hey day of comedy shows centering around middle aged people such as the mary tyler moore show and its subsequent spin offs such rhoda the bob newhart show and all in the family how things have changed since now most tv sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle aged people like the plague subsequently one of the young stars of love in the happy days a child actor from the andy griffith show named ron howard got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in called american graffitti directed by the relatively unknown george lucas whose previous thx had bombed miserably at the box office even when it was premiered to movie executives again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the s could become popular because it didnt fit with what had been popular in the past although they didnt realize that much of the movie going audience had been young in the s as everyone knows the movie was a huge hit and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience somewhere during the theatrical run of american graffitti tv executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like american graffitti they brought it back with the original cast plus henry wrinkler as the fonz re titled it happy days and the rest is tv history as it became one of the most popular shows of the shappy days now seems ridiculous the characters are flat and cardboard never being more or less than what they superficially are the issues they deal with are trivial and their reactions appear mindless and even silly nowadays the character of the fonz seems to be a caricature of well the fonz was the idea to be a kind of parody of marlon brandos character in the wild one looking on the show with fresh eyes i feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the s with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks this is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time american graffitti has many of the outward appearances of happy days but it had an edge it had an honesty about the characters and their issues happy days took the look of american graffitti but failed to take its heart,negative
its been months and you know what that meansa new seagal movie seagal has really been on role making horrible film after horrible film each time every movie getting worse and worse hes really amazing i dont really know what to say about tyd first its a piece of crap the story makes no sense at all secondly he uses stunt men in all his fight scenes and last but not least a lot of the footage is taken from other movies it amazes how this guy continues to find work he comes to the set late and leaves early and because of that his films are full of plot holes and stunt men why do we continue to buy his movies why do we continue to have hope that maybe just maybe he will make a great movie,negative
certainly expected more after seeing the cast list but wowi think a first time director could have done a better job with this project and the fact that a veteran like john buechler made it puzzles me to no end somehow the budget allowed them to secure a bevy of d list actors whom they succeeded in embarrassing for an hour and a half the unknown actors were just plain awful less steve wastell who does a decent job as axl the story is so bad that it really needs no mention the overall production value seems standard with some above average camera work if you can make it through the god awful slo mo scenes and the painful person on fire sequences i knew it would be dumb i just had no idea how dumb and unfortunately its time spent that can never be returned to me i suppose if you enjoy really bad b films this might work for you but if you value any story at all this one is simply dreadful a complete waste of time,negative
what to say about dead end roadlets just say that edgar allen poe would have been so ashamed the acting writing effects and everything in this movie was just horrendous that doesnt even do justice this movie was the biggest piece of garbage i have ever had to sit through that is also why i stopped it about minutes before the ending because personally i didnt care what happened to the characters i have seen bad but this was definitely the worst i got hyped up for this because i am a fan of poe and this was just bad just bad what upsets me more is that you cant rate films with negative numbers,negative
woman with wig who dyes her hair in the middle of the film takes of wig presumably does not see what the audience can see from miles away begin spoiler alert that her hubby is having an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try get rid of her end of spoiler alert and what a spoiler that was the title already gives it away doesnt it bad acting bad script waste of time oh yeah in the end she lives happily ever afterif you liked this movie youll really love cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death,negative
i dont understand why critics would bash this movie its a teen movie thats actually serious which is a rarity ill admit that there are moments that are hugely sappy but cmon its about young love its gotta be sappy to be valid my biggest complaint is chris klein while he was funny in american pie he apparently isnt ready for the switch into more dramatic fare yet hes very uncomfortable looking in some of his mama stuff hartnett and sobieski on the other hand demonstrate a remarkable amount of depth and believability as do the parents although the script is heavily cliched with the lovers spouting off poetry the actors make it work the directing sports some powerful images on the screen beautiful cinematography nice music great young actors i was impressed and im a jaded critic when it comes to teen movies,positive
the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better coaching they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably,negative
i like it because of my recent personal experience especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their real lives but they did enjoy themselves ie what they were the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities this made the conversations between the characters interesting not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story the end was not quite important after all you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie movies are supposed to be enjoyable this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it i am on a journey too the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions,positive
most of the positive comments posted here are as verbose as the movie it takes a long winded bore to appreciate a wordy and boring film one supposes some have merely called the film contemplative meaning slow and devoid of plot however one dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a realtor who predictably talks non stop and regardless of what else is going on so does just about every other characterthe only silences in this picture are dream sequences s soviet propaganda snippets and they are also its most interesting parts this tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie isthe device of filming most of the scenes in extreme closeup as if one were looking through a crack in the blinds gets old fast,negative
due to budget cuts ethel janowski again played by priscilla alden is released from a mental institution even though she killed six people and delivered to the hope bartholomew halfway house once there she immediately relapses into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her foodholy moly does this movie suck you know you are in trouble when the open credits start up and they are just the credits from the first film apparently filmed off a tv screen nick millard under his pseudonym nick phillips decided to return to the world of crazy fat ethel over ten years later and with a budget that probably covered the cost of a blank tape and a video camera rental for the weekend lets just say that millards unique style doesnt translate well to video seriously i have made home movies with more production value than this and millard tries to pull a silent night deadly night by padding half the running time with footage from the first film which looks like it was taken off a worn vhs copy alden is again good as ethel but the film is so inept that you start to feel sorry for her for starring in this garbage i mean at least the first film tried here we have no music weaker effects if that is at all possible shaky camera work horrible audio and editing that looks like it was done with two vcrs hooked up avoid this at all costs,negative
bollywood fans pretty much hold amitabh bachans mard in high regard but i think it is very overrated manmohan desai collaborated before on movies like suhaagparvarishamar akbar anthonynaseebdesh premee and coolie and i have seen all of them i liked so i had very high expectations before i watched mard and was bitterly disappointed my main gripe about mard is that it feels like amar akbar anthony part maybe mr desai ran out of ideas after all he had been using that formula for years and years first of all some members of the cast is repeated from aaa for instance the police inspector who brings up amar the muslim who brings up akbar nirupa roy and a few more in aaa nirupa roy loses her eyesight in mard she loses her voice in aaa there is the famous song shirdi wale sai babawell in mard we have amitabh singing maa sherawali having seen aaa for over times i noticed that straight awaymy other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous true manmohan desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with mard i thought he went too far my last gripe is that compared to songs in previous manmohan desai movies i found the songs rather disappointing i know it has many fans that swear by it but i didnt like it one bit it actually pains me to write this review because i am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since i was a child,negative
everyone likes the coolly created memorable heist movie alain delon provides the antihero melville provides the cool and a handful of other great talent yves montand gian maria volonte and andre bourvil mostly arrives to add a crisp engaging moviewith very little dialog this is great because one certain aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialog involving the quick witted and their various repartees this movie however could be watched with the sound completely off and not too terribly much would be missed not to say the sound is bad oh no the jazzy soundtrack and the crisp audio catching the little movements makes the slow patient deliberation of the patients very compellingwhats also really neat about this film is that the color cinematography is pretty fantastic usually when it comes to cinematography black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind but this film has some very strong and beautiful imagery that makes the movie pure visual pleasure to observe polarisdib,positive
the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner director john bud cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds moreover cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana christopher mitchum as the concerned richard marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny and scott c kolden as the gutsy steve the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures neat stop motion animation monsters said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy a big lumpy fanged beast and a scrawny lizard dude and nifty matte paintings richard bands rousing full bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot john arthur morrills crisp sunny cinematography likewise does the trick a fun flick,positive
ill say it again this movie was totally lame kids will like it sure but adultsdoubtful the whole thing was basically a rehash of the original which is to be expected since they pretty much explored the whole concept in the first movie but still did they have to completely rehash the entire movie i mean everything is re done from the little mermaid the worst part of it is morgana ursulas crazy sister who appears out of nowhere and threatens melody which is ridiculous since triton is there with his magic trident why didnt triton do anything about it because the plot required him to do nothing i could go on but i wont the whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid and was obviously thrown together without any thought because they knew it would sell overall it is a terrible waste of time,negative

holes is an awesome movie i love it a lot and its one of my favorite films its one of the few flicks produced by disney that isnt cheesy holes is generally a very cool motion picture i wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool dont get the wrong idea i dont mean to bad mouth disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and thats okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny really its the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate toholes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this,positive
this is a delightful movie that is so over the top that my wife daughter and i found it irresistible the plot is just crazy but rings true to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous improbabilities and impossibilities i particularly enjoyed kevin klines and sally fields performances i dont anyone better than kline at playing thickheaded fields characters truly desperate need for attention and affirmation and her almost bipolar swings in mood played nicely against the background of fields famous infamous you like me oscar exclamation people who can take themselves with such a large grain of salt are all too rare in this world i think this is the only movie where i didnt find myself impatient with whoopi goldberg characterization i thought she was spot on in every note she struck robert downey jr teri hatcher cathy moriarty and elizabeth shue were also first rate as well just a great movie if youre in the mood to go along for the ride and laugh,positive
this is an interesting series that takes real life people jesse james john wesley hardin etcand dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story railroad detective matt clark takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the old west in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts in that sense its almost an anthology series and as someone else pointed out this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events but its a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western hungry s audience and it still holds up pretty well years later clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of historys baddest baddies and his girl sidekick frankie is quite a dish if youre a western fan be sure to check it out if you have a chance,positive
the first full length film featuring the aardman characters wallace and gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half hour show which aired on televisionwallace runs a company to humanely capture rogue rabbits from peoples vegetable gardens and has the bright idea to try out his invention on the hapless bunnies once theyre caught of course as in other wallace and gromit films things dont quite work out as plannedsimilarly to a close shave theres a love interest for wallace in this case the village lady posh and a big mean villain with a bullish dog gromit is beautifully animated with a wide range of expressions making the character laugh out loud funny and of course peter sallis provides the voice of wallace again and is a perfect fitand as in a grand day out cheese features heavily to great comedic effect as the film moves alongon the negative side this film is a little on the long side there are great effects and some pieces which make you sit up and watch but perhaps this story would have worked better as another short subject rather than pushing it to feature length,positive
dont know what film or version jeff saw but this entire film was awesome not just poitier and going the story was riveting suspenseful and engaging and for the guy complaining about historical accuracy get real yes there were some black deputy marshals in the indian territory but they had no authority to arrest whites outside of indian territory as a rule they did not patrol but exercised warrants on criminals only i did find it odd that corby didnt seem to have any indian friends i know their numbers were diminished but it still strikes me as strange even as corby returned to his people his indian cohorts remain faceless and nameless,positive
i just saw this film in santa barbara my friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought id check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little strange but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left the theater thinking about the film it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique,positive
karim hussains masterpiece of art gore this cat is definitely a talent to look out for we have in this several longer vignettes interspliced with some shorter segues this is all in all a very powerful film that relies on its intense graphic imagery and symbolism and it is not for all viewersthe film kicks off with a short called ovarian eyeball very short segment that has a nude woman placed on a table naked an unseen womans hand covers the supine womans face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen out of which an eyeball stalk is extracted ive got nothing too much to comment on this one due to its brevityhuman larvae is one of the films lynchpins and it is a totally unflinching portrayal of a perverse act committed by a disturbed man who has an incestuous love for his pregnant sister this is one of those must be seen to be believed type things i will say that this film has some of the best effects ive seen in an indie horror film but the subject matter will make this an undeniably unpleasant experience for most not me though i live for thisrebirth could have been cut out of this film all together this is the films weakest segment and it has a bunch of nude people fcking bloody holes in a field and whatnot very short but this one kind of blows the films momentumright brain martyrdom is one of the most profane representations of religious imagery that i have ever seen and it totally kicks ass think p iss christ or menstrual blood paintings of the virgin mary very hard sexual sexually violent gory imagery is presented in this piece and it is definitely not for anyone who will be offended by sacrilegesubconscious cruelty is one of the best films ive seen under the banner of extreme horror it will be a very divisive film amongst horror fans and the filmgoing public in general some will call it trash some will call it brilliant i dont see much middle ground i thought this film was pretty damn original and i will recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it,positive

whoopi was the only reason i watched the oscars that year she is hilarious of course there was a major serious side to the show she was great not only because shes funny but because she said some things that needed to be said in a public forum white folks need to be reminded that hollywood awards ceremonies employment and representation are way out of balance racially there should be no need for black awards shows the white bread milquetoast nominators and judges need to bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to white directors producers actors etc allowing woody allen on the air was the depth of poor taste he had no business being there the fact of the matter is this is the first oscar presentation ive watched since the color purple was up for awards that miscarriage of voting soured me on watching the shows until which is not to denigrate other presenters billy crystal is a riot,positive
surface was one of the few truly unique shows on tv last season i can honestly say i modified my schedule so i could be home to watch every episode tons of action suspense science fiction etcstory was of a boy who found an egg that hatched into a sea creature the same sea creature that had killed the main characters brother and the woman character oceanographer had seen most people think it is a deadly killing machine but the one raised from the egg was very friendlyonly problem is nbc canceled it so now well never know what happens hopefully sci fi or some other channel will pick it up,positive
to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clichés and boring stereotyped characters nerds jocks popular girls sleezy guys etc but with an underlying anti drug drinking theme if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real dunno how else to word it i guess the only thing thatd make this film cool would be if they tv playing it was on fire that or dvd it was on exploded out of watch animal house instead,negative
i thought it was brilliant it was great watching the presenter tracking each one of them down dwight schultz still looked the same he had hardly changed in looks neither had dirk benedict he still looked just as dishy i thought that mr t looked thinner though but it was still great to see how he looked after all this time i thought that it took some doing tracking down the other members of the cast such as the one who played decker and the lady who played amy it was just a shame that mr t couldnt make the actual reunion also it was a great shame that george peppard had died thereby leaving a gap so to speak i only wish now that i had taped it to keep lets hope that they repeat it again,positive
i had never heard of dead mans bounty when i saw it at the dvd store a few weeks ago and i thought i had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had val kilmer in it in a truly unique role sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that i realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions the first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long its unbelievable how bad it is and sadly it doesnt get any betterval kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of half wit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that ive ever seen in a movie hes played by boguslaw linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the american old west does poland have this type of frontier past i dont know my knowledge of polish history is not my strong point but i can tell you this the sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that i can ever remember seeing in a movie he is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose what the hell is this crap i am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie throughout the movie the sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling not withoutthe law you see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie it takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road my understanding is that it is a part of poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the american southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come fromi have heard that val kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages yeah whatever seems to me that kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role personally i would really feel that i had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while i like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did i am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the roleat any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by kilmer seeking the reward soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters there is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of american rituals in one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into kilmers eyes for what reason i cant imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel what the hell not convinced yet here are some more reasons not to watch it in one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick a man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood in a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder smart near the end the sheriff appears to have a broken arm sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink also smart why doesnt he just use his good arm i have no idea that like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title summer love are you kidding me avoid this mess at all costs in the meantime heres something for the imdb goofs page errors made by characters possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers this movie got made ha,negative
i hate to throw out lines like this but in this case i feel like i have to the american remake of the grudge is by far the worst film i have seen in theaters in the last years there i said it and now that i have gotten that out of my system please let me explain whywhen someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born the curse gathers in that place of death those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury that is the premise of the grudge and i will admit it sounds intriguing unfortunately the filmmakers take it no further those who encounter the curse are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get you want more well too bad some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of the grudge is to scare you the problem is that when there is no plot to speak of creepy images and sounds can only go so far director takashi shimizu pulling a george sluizer and remaking his own original films valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over it pretty much unfolds like this person walks into house something flashes by the camera and or a strange sound is heard person goes to investigate sound starts to get loud person sees a ghost loud scream and or cat screech cut to blackbefore the audience is even given a hint of plot this exact same scenario unfolds times in the first hour the first time was actually somewhat creepy each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on by the time the end of the film rolled around my friend and i were laughingly wondering if this scene would end with a loud scream and a cut to black we were never proved wrongthe film has no liner storyline instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled i have no problem with non linear storytelling when it is done right the film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason i havent seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of highlander and this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had if you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic and why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyoneobviously greenlit the second the american version of the ring made million its first weekend the grudge is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie the scariest things about the grudge are that it made million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the scariest movie ever made i wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see the grudge,negative
if you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the hollywood scene made it to where they are the vast majority will tell you assuming they will tell that a strange coincidence took place they happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects quinten tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew harvey keitel kevin spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role and robin williams credits his career to gary marshalls son who after having seen star wars suggested to his father that an alien should visit the cunninghams of happy days these coincidences many times viewed as pure luck shapes many of the careers in hollywood today or is it pure luck is possible something else is going on grand canyon written and directed by lawrence kasdan proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable aka the strange miraculous coincidence the movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstancekevin kline a middle aged father experiences a break down in one of the more dangerous areas of la after he phones a tow truck a young gang accosts him they threaten violence if he doesnt leave his car just before the confrontation can escalate danny glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang although glover denies it later he probably saved klines life a producer steve martin of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience he then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment and klines wife clair mary mcdonnell while on a morning jog finds a baby hidden in some foliage she claims the baby cried for her and that her rescue of the infant was preordainedthe movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships end to relationships and new beginnings and all the while a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going onit is very rare in hollywood or for film in general to explore such a purely esoteric subject there are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable but maybe thats the point what makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast although the miracles and coincidences may seem far fetched the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities maybe this is a subject we should explore more often,positive
well i just paid a dollar for a dvd of this movie and it wasnt even worth that it seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain i am guessingneagle despite her glory awards and reputation is a homely british gal who cant sing or dance or actsome of the fine old hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic director herbert wilcox neagles husband always thought anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen he was mistaken she was improbably popular in britain before and after wwii her serious roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance hereonly a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented skip this one and find the one that stars doris day at least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing,negative

what makes this documentary special from a film making perspective is its passiveness which engages the audience to bask in the delight of gypsy music it innovates the form of documentary while showcasing a tapestry of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of historically traveling peoplesindeed the film itself is a single take of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one rhythmic culture to the nextwatching this film ones breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music rhythm and dance if there is a more deeply spiritual flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures it has yet to be filmed,positive
i really love this movie i havent played final fantasy vii but i still loved the movie its really funny and i love the job the voice over actors have done the visuals are so fantastic and all the lines are so well donei have to admit i have a pretty good imagination so i was able to fill most of the gaps the movie presented and i suggest you watch it twice because lots of things suddenly make sensealso this is pretty funny you should watch it with the subtitles on because what they say and what the subs say are sometimes completely different its really usually pretty funny but sometimes it helps u to understand what they say betterwatch it love marnie,positive
after watching some of hbos great stuff band of brothers rome etc i must say i had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of true blood jeez often the script seemed to be written by an year old some parts are just horribly filmed the scene in which she saves bill i mean come on she throws a chain at the guy and ow it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion or a few moments before that scene when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill ridiculous she hears them plan their stuff and like seconds later magic the of them are gone and without any struggle or noise or anythingi mean the idea of the show seemed interesting mysterious intriguing vampires co existing with human in our modern society but honestly i dont think they really wanted to make more of this than a petty soap show that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about unfortunately the script is written poorly mediocre at best its shallow and extremely predictable often i thought that this was some kind of a joke or something the actors deliver really unconvincing performances if you want my opinion they seem to take the show very lightly as if it were some kind of a regular low budget family tv show well maybe thats what it is if you take away the family part the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen moyer in the role of bill considering the poorly written extremely short replies he had to say what are you can i give you a call sometime i think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have actually anna paquin was okay as well but not more but the guy playing her brother though jeez hes horrible the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply a shame to modern television the acting is bad the construction site looks fake to the bone and the two other guys why is he getting arrested uh i dunno that was pretty embarrassing another thing that i think was completely missed was the way they presented sookies psychic powers they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic as if peoples thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think and finally the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting dont get me wrong i wrote all these comments not because i thought the show was bad but because i was very disappointed i expected quality stuff i didnt think it was going to be like that its definitely not a good show though mediocre at best,negative
but this just isnt working and i am surprised to see how many people consider it good on what grounds there are some loose hints here and there but the whole material is self indulgent and unconvincing lynchs movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet are very playful when doing that there is some visual sense there are some subplots characters ideas etc but this is dull and yes pointless because whatever there is to explore is either to small either too far fetched or simply told before in a superior manner its just lynch exploring dv nothing more so it should be treated like this,negative
this is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant that really is if you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point you could describe fosca as manipulative but what if it is really serious that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isnt answered but what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you and is only rejected by the fact that you are ugly wouldnt you fight for it at least i think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness and it reminds me of the fact how i as a man react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of fosca and dont look further at the person she is or might be this movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect trust feeling manipulated and so on how do i now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact what i think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that ettore scola made it absolutely believable that giorgio falls in love with fosca,positive
sure it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny but at least the filmmakers didnt try while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy but the scene with the mountain lion was intense i was kind of annoyed by jason priestlys role in the film as a rebellious shock jock but then again its a tv movie despite all of the good things the soundtrack was atrocious however it was nice to see tucson arizona prominently featured in the film,positive
im not surprised that so many people fell for this one when i was watching this movie a couple viewers next to me sobbed whenever youre supposed to sob or at least feel touched like when hunting said he didnt love the girl like when robin williams character sorry i forgot his roles name was telling hunting repeatedly its not your fault oh lord just thinking of that scene gives me the goosebumps i couldnt have cared less for what would happen to the characters many people sob for hollywood manufactured characters they cant even relate to think titanic yuck but it really only made me cringe and want to get out of the theatre i guess i simply refuse to be psychically and emotionally manipulated by all thisfolks its not me whos being condescending those characters are and for no good reason because theyre unreal worse yet nothing is new or surprising even robin williams character is all clichedi gave it out of its probably not that bad its just quite mediocre but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it a so i figured a single balancing vote wont hurt,negative
roll is a wonderful little film toby malone plays an year old kid very well acted by the way who is into soccer malones cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym bags a drug lord some tough bikers some cops and some prostitutes and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law what the contents of either gym bag is and even what gender a key biker is parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking barrelsfor me roll reinforced three opinions that i already held before seeing roll those opinions are i really want to visit australia one day the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation some of the best filmmakers in the are australian the cinematography in roll was especially impressive i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes australian women are hot,positive
im from romania ill try to speak in english all i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one seen it above times at least and will see it for many years now it has all the little things i like in a movie its very touching makes me cry shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality and the true things that matter for different people it so happens that for me this matters the most the love the soul of a man hes inner being and this i see in this movie perhaps for me its much more than a motion picture its a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate its a long way from reality to sci fi but what if what if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down would fall we would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that on your death bed the bigger thing you remember is not the wealth not the adventure not the countries you visited and the people that remember you but the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more watch this movie and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me hail from romania,positive
the recent dvd release of good humor man labels the film as comedy its hardly a comedy rather a dull indie film about a group of losers supposedly set in the s there is scant attention paid to period details with overly muted color correction taking its place the monotonous soundtrack only serves to accentuate the repetitiveness of the film perhaps that is the point but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience apprarently the clique of losers only like to hang out at one location the bleachers it seems like the packaging of the film as a comedy is meant to deceive people into renting or buying this film which is a complete waste of time,negative
people watch movies for a variety of different reasons this movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effects no car chases and theres no explosions actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life this is a very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brainso watch this movie for the characters it is brim full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael haydens life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his harvey and kiefers mickey enhances the oppositeness of their charactersi thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady mrs ramsay im sure she and my mother in law are good friendstheres a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them,positive
the many other comments about the film say it all just like to add that we showed it last week to around at our community cinema and it got an overall average score of wed recommend it then for todays audiences especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen and can talk about it with others afterwards as our audience didthe sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding of course finney and courtenay were truly the stars but everybody was thoroughly well cast for our afternoon audience the majority of whom are senior citizens the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non techy use of camera and sound was a great influencehow delightful many said to see a really great film thats british still not dated twenty years on not full filled with blood guts not confusing because of bob about all over the place camera shots and back and forth through time story lines no seedy sex scenes such views were even uttered by some who were younger,positive
i gave this a there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for total mayhem everyone gets killed or nearly so i am tired of cross hairs and changing views i cannot give the plot away convoluted and insane if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back i wish reviews were more honest,negative

a truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by giblets wrestles with mattresses runs full on into closed doors just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of the naked truth i loved what i caught of this show enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show tea leoni as nora wilde cute clownish and wonderfully accident prone how refreshing to see an actress who can clown its no wonder hollyood doesnt seem to know how to cast her but where oh where are the dvd releases the amount of bleep they release its incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried someone please correct me if im wrong,positive
i once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as rambo baise moi deep impact but mr seidl almost succeeded hundstage was a truly awful experience anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards it shows a world where love and humanity dont exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence by choosing a documentary like style with non professional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock cartoonist deix director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian european western suburbs the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies violence against women and handicapped people madness and degradation but this isnt social criticism this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value instead you get bad acting bad cinematography bad filmmaking if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes this is pseudo social criticism with a sledge hammer and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way it shows ugly people that is not the reason why i hate it but it depicts average people in an ugly misanthropic way and this is why this film is truly despicable,negative

james bishop matt stasi goes to a mental illness facility for a medical residence assignment with dr mccort bruce paynes there he realizes that many interns are being killed by the ripper who takes their souls to the devil in a cult promoted by dr mccort this story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary the dialogs are so ridiculous specially when the character of helen the blonde fiancé of james bishop arrives in the asylum that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay and what about the return of james to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients and the cast composed of ham actors and actresses honestly i do not know what or who is the worst in this film the screenplay the director or the cast the correct answer certainly is all of them i saw this flick on cable television and i am astonished how can a producer spend money in such a garbage this horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot my vote is threetitle brazil demnio devil,negative
looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this version that looked interesting wow it was amazing very much a ken russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right,positive

if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captainafter ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire lifeacting there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law againpaltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decisionstory soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progressesdirecting none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deali would have to give this movie a out of avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release,negative
mgm tried pairing up and coming young men with the divine one to give them exposure and try them out as leading men gable and garbo had chemistry in susan lenox but it was a lousy film here in inspiration there is no chemistry whatsoever between garbo and robert montgomery and the script is poor as well what were they thinking the modern fast talking wise crack snapping montgomery and the long suffering garbo it is a tale like camille young student falls for woman of the world and is repelled by learning of her past rejects her takes her back rejects her you get the picture garbo is completely believable as a top parisian artists model and completely at home although bored with her life at the top of society amidst her artistic friends and their loose morals suddenly she is fascinated by this innocent she finally gives up her life for him and sinks into poverty only to be rescued by him and set up in a house of her own ironically he intends to marry and keep her on the side so much for his pure moral ethic of earlierthe scenes are incredibly dull and boring and nothing much happens only marjorie rambeau as lulu is able to inject life into the proceedings with such lines as unfortunately weak women have strong appetites and odette where is thy stingonly for garbo fans,negative
this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy it is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy the fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character tom oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another the only saving graces are the competent performance by toni collete and the frequency with which we glimpse paltrows pleasant face overall to be avoided,negative
i rented this movie roughly years ago and was instantly disappointedi wanted to see a b movie slasher flick but ended up with a fecal matter for my eyes the acting was similar to watching grass dry ive seen better acting in a softcore filmthe idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere baffled me how was this a horror moviethis movies production value was laughable at best there were no scares it seemed like a high school student got a new video camera for christmas the plot was all over the place if existent if you are bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent skip this one there are much better b movies out there,negative
the riddle was written and directed by brendan foley in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the charles dickens novels into a contemporary story but that attempt is thwarted by electing to use the two periods of time format in which the riddle is unraveled despite a cast of well known actors trying their best to pull off this direct to dvd movie the end product is a long tedious amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films mike sullivan vinnie jones is a journalist confined to reporting on dog racing events while he dreams of important reporting assignments a series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of mikes sadie vera day who runs a pub on the banks of the thames having just discovered an old valuable unpublished manuscript by charles dickens and has a heart of gold giving sandwiches away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp beachcomber derek jacobi sadies murder attracts mike to the role of detective journalism and with the help of policewoman kate julie cox he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the dickens manuscript disrupting the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to dickens time as dickens again derek jacobi narrates a rather personal story of peculiar murders the parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in anothers hands but the finessing of this kind of venture escapes writer director brendan foley he draws his story to a close at long last with a tired hollywoodesque ending in addition to jones jacobi cox and day the film somehow attracted the attention of vanessa redgrave jason flemyng ph moriarty and mel smith their contributions are minimal but happily distracting this is a flimsy bit of treacle leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding grady harp,negative
if you enjoy suspense this movie has it the fact that marina zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense alec guinesss appearance was nice but didnt really add to the movie im not sure if evan richards part as andy clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot i thought the cinematography was excellent this added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well the bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to andy clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done i would call it overall good entertainment,positive
only one thing could have redeemed this sketch a healthy gunfight between the happy couple the exotic model at the delicatessen and the old timer from the motel who was it would have turned out secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent boy to the guys when theyd shared the rubber house in the process they could have blown that freezing shack to smithereens resolved most of the snags such as the whore bitch ode on the windscreen the reason why the protagonist had no friends as well as explaining his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon incessant phone calls and that crawl space chic the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life quite the technician with the human body though ex abortionist morgue attendant a bit of a heartbeat would have been niceit was fun watching these people move around i guess but eleanoras silly italian games were suffocatingly stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes a dick a mind and a pick up truck about summed it up for him i also wished they could have had a bit more luggage eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the moteltrifling matters you may well say i agree although the niggling bits just didnt add up right in this rush job good owl wrangling though and i really felt cold all the way through,negative
since i am a fan of natalie portman i had to see the movie i enjoyed every minute of it it plays out in a very sincere way throughout the whole movie at seemed as if natalie was the mother and susan was the mother susans character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of iti heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving natalie and some guy hes in outside providence but natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed and i think that is great i think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the filmnatalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because i havent seen her in a bad film yet so any movie that has natalie portman will no doubt be seen by mea good film,positive

enjoyable film that gives you romance women on the verge psychodrama work place sexual harassment adultery and fashion its all there typical characters found in corporate america joan crawford is the usual long time employee bitch executive who feels the need to be such because shes with the big boys hope lange is the entry level ambitious employee whose determined to get to the top by using her mind and not her body their personal lives is the subplot wardrobe for the film is great but someone forgot to tell stephen boyds hairstylist that a little dab will do ya the amount of brylcream in stephen boyds hair is distracting at times his characters relationship with langes character was never fully developed which i found disappointing overall the movie is enjoyable rating,positive
given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing soif you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camera work my year old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plot narrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic dont appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i cant believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didnt tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didnt tell me she was going on a dateokay so the budget is low that doesnt mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the score is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writers directors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall a death metal band from swedenthe most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel,negative
of all the movies ive seen this one rates almost at the bottom haunted mansion nothing but trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom it is hasty the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted of course we have to lay some of this at the book writers door the book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical oprah gives a palatable appearance as biggers mom but is not nearly at her potential other famous performers also seem to be at their worst the plot which centers around an african american who decided to take a job as a chauffeur in driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted one thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk now the family hes working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are so when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins caterwauling the blind mother yes hears this so bigger tries to silence her but instead smothers her now fearing hes really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do he shoves her into the coal furnace so investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace the idiot didnt have the foresight to get rid of the ashes he is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom if your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th s and s or see a good drama there are a lot better options avoid this,negative
in the eighties savage steve holland put out three movies two of which are classics of what seems to be a very small genre absurdist teen comedies the third how i got into college does not measure up to better off dead and this one mainly because of its lack of john cusack and curtis armstrong except for a tiny cameoone crazy summer is an underrated movie with lots of great characterizations and gags as i recall savage steves movies were vilified as being brain dead at the time and after three movies he drifted into childrens tv we could use more movies from the likes of him,positive
i should say at the outset there are many many things i love about forbidden planet and yes i certainly consider it a classic science fiction film for many reasons but the adulation it has received over the years goes a bit over the top in my opinion no less an authority than leonard maltin says forbidden planet is one of the most ambitious and intelligent movies of its genre ambitious without a doubt intelligent depends on what part of the film youre talking about it certainly was the most prestigious and highly budgeted science fiction flick to that point at a cost of nearly million this was remember mgm pulled out all the stops to produce a dazzling eye popping outer space adventure unlike anything seen on the big screen before even employing artists from the disney studio for some of the more elaborate special effects charming is not usually a word used to describe special effects in sci fi movies yet that is the one that seems most appropriate here even the dreaded monster from the id is only a well rendered cartoon figure by the disney people unlikely to frighten anyone over the age of when i see the various sets and take note of the art design models costumes etc i am reminded of nothing so much as the wizard of oz with its gorgeously saturated colors and elaborate if not always convincing effects so much work has gone into these films that one is inclined to smile in admiration at the effort regardless forbidden planet is wonderful to look at the scenes take place on obvious stage sets that are fabulously decorated matte paintings of planets and space in the background and intricately designed miniature sand dunes and so forth to give the illusion of depth its a bit like watching the most elaborately produced stage play youd ever see the most believable and convincing scenes are probably the ones inside the massive krell complex where shots showing the vast depth and width of this inner space are well done and credible but then we get to the actors darn it the performances are almost uniformly awful though in fairness one has to say the dialogue hardly ever transcends the level of adolescent locker room humor except for some passages of barely adequate scientific technobabble even the great actor walter pidgeon is reduced to giving such a hammy performance its lugubrious at times a very young leslie nielsen stars as the spaceship commander jj adams and doesnt convey an ounce of believability or conviction in the entire film he seems to instinctively know thirty years ahead of time that his true forte lay in comedy as there are times he seems barely able to keep a straight face reciting his lines every forced reaction whether it is anger or passion or solemn meditation looks right out of a high school play anne francis also very young fares a little better as the supposedly innocent alta whom we are to believe has never seen a human male other than her father until the crew of the spaceship shows up alta morbius now theres a name for you unfortunately even at this early age anne francis seems about as virginal and naive as elizabeth taylor in butterfield there is a good story here buried somewhere beneath the crew mates leering comments about alta and yet another juvenile subplot concerning earl hollimans cookie ships cook holliman turns in a horrendous performance too im guessing all these actors went straight from this movie to acting school based on shakespeares the tempest the story of a dead race the krell and the fantastic world of machines they left behind is what most people tend to remember about forbidden planet and for good reason for a few minutes here and there you can forget about the rest of the movie and be dazzled by the disney artists conception of the krell underground complex is it enough to make up for the rest of the films shortcomings youll have to decide that on your own oh and of course theres robby the robot every s ten year olds idea of what a robot should look and talk like hes funny in places so forbidden planet to me is a very very mixed bag it deserves credit for being the inspiration for a whole wave of sci fi films and tv shows that followed not least of which was star trek but i would suggest that anyone who thinks its more than well staged comic book sci fi go back and watch it again,positive
the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie fixated on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i wouldve switched to the latest news on the starr report thats how boring i found this movie,negative
when i saw this movie for the first time i didnt believe my own eyes in front of me there was a great and well done parody of valentino see stan laurel bullfight that way is like to see an excellent fencer in action its a very good parody rich of ideas with a clever and charming stan old and good like whiskey or the booze up after that,positive
this is truly a funny movie his dance scene done with the tape is one of the funniest scenes i can recall i thought the i am gay scene at the high school graduation ceremony a bit surrealistic though it was funny while watching it for the third time i started to pick up on a little small segments that i had missed one was when matt dillons girl friend a classic ditz tried to use a dial phone which she had never used before kevin klein made this film successful along tom selleck this was also the first time i could appreciate debbie reynolds she proved that she can be funny she confirmed this in the tv series will and grace one discovery that i found after the third viewing is lauren ambrose of feet under fame she sticks out with her red bangs but it is obvious that this is one of her first films bob newhart is also very funny at the high school principle,positive
this film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man called grey owl in s canada i found it to be similarly riveting and heartfelt as rudy and awakenings it picks up late in grey owls life and follows him through his most tumultuous and influential periodthe film is about a canadian indian trapper who finds himself promoting the plight of the over trapped beaver he also predicts the decrease in natural lands and the overuse of earths resources this is an outrageous concept in the s and surprisingly well received he becomes a well known speaker and the masses are ready to listenthe casting of pierce brosnan seems rather odd but is not outrageous anyone wanting to argue that point must first watch the movie to understand brosnan provides a wonderful performance as does annie galipeau galipeau is a strong actress whose place beside brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced pairings in recent bond filmsi would recommend this film to anyone interested in good drama beautiful scenery or environmental causes it is a movie for families as well however children under depending on maturity would have trouble following the plot,positive
i dont understand why everyone hates this movie aside from the fact that theyre just jealous their music careers never took off like mega popstar aaron carter like it or not aaron has seen more success in his young life than most people could ever dream of having so it only seemed natural for him to do a movie lou pearlman and company have been known for over exploiting their pop protégées you remember justin timberlakes foray into tv movie model behavior granted this movie isnt big scale and impressive but its not supposed to be its not trying to impress people or be an emmy award winner it was released straight to dvd its just a cute little movie about an awkward teen who gets her dream of being with her favorite popstar i know a lot of you out there have had that dream at some point or another about you favorite singer dont deny it its sweet and gentle and i applaud it for not stepping into the realm of sex violence and vulgar language that seem to be creeping into more and more of our movies today wheres the decency wheres the line teen dramas come in dozens these days because teens are a big market for companies at least this one is more tolerable to me than bratz aka slutz with all the fake little girls running around going oh mah gawd in tank tops and mini skirts and is fathoms better than those gore fest movies like saw i feel for the main character girl because i was nerdy outcast girl in high school who loved aaron carter and nsync and the backstreet boys and other pop music and still do and like aarons character would get crushing testophobia especially in math if you judge this movie solely based on the fact that you dont like or are jealous of aaron carter and his fame then of course youre going to hate it and trash talk it in reviews the only reason britney spears dribble crossroads got a higher score is because she has boobs accept this movie for what it is not what you want it to be i think this happy formulaic teen movie ends on a high note and makes you want to sing,positive

betty is an understudy for the lead in a production of verdis macbeth when a car mysteriously hits the lead betty is thrust into the spotlight opening night is a smashing success and betty decides to leave the after party to celebrate in private with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend leaves the room betty is grabbed from behind by an unknown black gloved masked figure the unknown assailant ties betty to a column gags her and places needles under her eyes that will cause incredible damage and pain should betty close them the boyfriend returns to the room and is stunned to see betty in such a predicament hes even more shocked when the killer grabs him and shoves a knife through his lower jaw with such force the tip of the knife can clearly be seen in his mouth and betty has been forced to watch all of this so begins bettys terrifying ordeal with a killer not just intent on hurting her but also on forcing her to watch as he mutilates her friendsopera gets classified as a giallo but to me it differs in quite a few ways from the model less emphasis is placed on the mystery elements of the story than in something like argentos tenebre or the bird with the crystal plumage the black gloved masked killer may be omnipresent but the clues and red herrings normally associated with a good giallo are absent instead opera is all about the tension of an unknown killer and making the audience uncomfortable the focus is on the grisly death scenes bettys fear and the killers obsession with bettyopera features what i think are some of argento most artistic death scenes when the killer grabs betty after her boyfriend leaves the room youre sure that bettys had it but the sadistic killer only wants to force betty to watch as he brutally stabs her lover in the neck the knife emerging in his mouth its a well shot and designed scene and those needles in the eyes brilliant or take the death of the seamstress at first her death seems like an ordinary run of the mill murder but when the seamstress accidentally swallows the killers locket what started out as just another death scene turns it up a notch as the killer uses a pair of scissors to cut the girls throat open to get his chain finally theres the most famous death scene in opera that im amazed with each time i see it mira is shot in the eye while peering through a keyhole that scene displays a lot of what i like about argento its got style to burn as implausible as it may be its creative memorable and a blast to watchargento certainly wasnt the first italian director to concentrate on eye mutilation but in opera hes taken eye trauma to a new level needles holding eyes open a bullet in the eye and ravens pecking out an eye are all part of argentos vision pun intended and these scenes do have the effect that i believe argento was going for the first time i saw the killer putting those needles in bettys eyes i couldnt stop blinking it actually had a physical effect on me what is it about the eyes that make them such a target for abuse in italian films to be fair and not sound like such a fanboy there are problems i have with opera that keep me from rating it as argentos best one of my problems is with the air duct system running through bettys apartment building while i dont doubt there are air duct systems in older apartment buildings that connect the apartments the ducts in opera are huge im no expert but i sincerely doubt any building like the one in this movie would have had such mammoth air ducts it doesnt seem practical at all and dont you think someone would have done something about them long ago to keep criminals and nosey neighbors out of the other apartments its convenient for the plot but its not very realisticbut i suppose my major problem with the film comes with the finale whats up with that ending it feels totally out of place tacked on and like a bad afterthought im not sure what else to say other than its horrible,positive
this film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous american movie is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary youll find equivalents on just about every corner in america it takes a long hard look at a guy whos failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movieor two were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art the movie might have had a chance america has an abundance of better stories to be told this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed two thumbs up indeed,negative

man oh man what a piece of crummy film making but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time where i grew up in san jose california right on the border of cupertino we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again wanda nevada was one of those movies i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the s the script makes almost no sense the direction is poor the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance a lot of dialog thats so bad its good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick and hey everybody knows there aint no gold in the grand canyon,negative
i didnt even want to watch this movie after reading maltins review and star rating i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected i would give it stars out of a star system you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all if you dont know much about religion you will miss a lot i graduated from high school the year the movie was made so maybe i can relate to it better yes there is some pretension in the movie and its weird to some extent but that was the s so what do you expect i can see why people might not like the movie however i cannot understand people saying it is boring the movie is anything but boring you will either hate it or love it if you find it boring you are probably brain dead,positive

some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure i loved this flick but i dont feel guilty about it you can tell the whole cast and crew had fun making this movie but jack frost wont go over well with some people right from the beginning you can tell this movie will be cheesy and it definitely has an amateurish look to it well if you get the privilege to watch this movie after watching it remember that jack frost revenge of the mutant killer snowman is a pleasure not a guilty pleasure now because i cant fill up ten lines heres some great scenes spoilers the three women on the beach had great deaths the first one had jack in a tree trying to drop icicles on one of them he kept missing so he dropped an anvil on her the next woman fell on a bed of icicles the last one was stabbed in the eyes with tongsthe other great one was where two surfers stoners are hanging out near a frozen pole one of them gets their tongue stuck on it of course jack frost pulls him back a rips his tongue off while saying cowa tongue a dude well you have to see it for yourselfand of course the snowball children kicked assend spoilersinfinity stars,positive
this is a movie that will leave you thinking is he or isnt he while many people have complained about the ambiguous ending it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs this is my interpretation and theory and i believe it is very sound first here is the plot one day prot kevin spacey suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station after attempting to help a woman from muggers he is arrested and sent to bellevue and later transferred to dr mark powells jeff bridges hospital prot freely talks about how he came from the planet k pax and is here to do a report on earth naturally he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward he befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story in fact he tells them he can take one person back with him soon dr powell is beginning to question prots insanity and as the plot progresses it is harder and harder to prove prot wrong in the end dr powell learns that prot is robert porter a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in new mexico when his wife and daughter were murdered prot claims that he plans to leave for k pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders the time comes and goes and powell finds prot or robert in a catatonic state one of the patients is missing and is never found again on to my theory prot is not crazy prot is from the planet k pax robert porter is a friend of prots on one of prots previous visits to earth robert was a child learning about the constellations from his father prot and robert became best friends after the death of his family and robert slaying the murderer robert decides to commit suicide prot is on k pax at the time but he rushes back in multiples of light speed to stop robert so prot takes over the thinking of robert taking over his body so to speak awhile later prot still inhabiting roberts body comes to new york and is locked up when he leaves for k pax on july he takes bess with him but he must leave roberts body behind hence we now have the catatonic robertexplanations or cluesprots knowledge of the planets around libra as prot says any child knows about their own system only a few people on earth had an inkling about the system and prot added to their knowledge robert porter while smart and knows his constellations was no astro physicist dr powell feels chosen by prot its true prot couldve left the institute at any time but chose not too prots last words to dr powell are now that youve found robert take care of him prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for robert when he left super human abilities it was a proven fact that prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see uv rays prot provides his usual k pax reason but there was no earthly reason given it was also mentioned that prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effecthelping the patients throughout the movie you see prot helping the other patients or the patients discussing prots suggestions to a better sane world while the psychologist balk at prots help dr powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leadingthe sprinkler scene the sprinkler is associated with porters home in new mexico which is ironically where roswell is does porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family is her trying to protect powells daughter from that horrible fate i have a different point of view it is assumed that porter had committed suicide in a river indeed prot under hypnosis is greatly concerned about robert i believe that prot associates the danger with the water not the sprinkler he is trying to protect the girl from watery death like he did roberthypnosis dr powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover prots true identity but while prot gives plenty of information he never gives up his prot persona and claimed homeland of k paxthe security camera why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason mysterious disappearances first prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north funny the patients are not at all alarmed indeed they try to reassure the doctor sometimes i think they understand better than the staff naturally the most telling disappearance is of bess the winner of the essay contest not only does she disappear at the approximate same time but the only remaining clue is her winning essaythis is only my humble theory you can conclude what you want you can take dr powells theory that prot was merely a persona taken up by robert porter to mentally defend himself from reality but that would be giving up too many plot holes,positive

while credited as a tom and jerry cartoon this is not the cat and mouse team but an earlier mutt and jeff rip off featuring them going to africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in while the dialect humor is mostly lame there is a brief musical sequence involving black skeletons that was entertaining i have to ask however how could tom and jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times one of many entries produced by the van beuren corporation for distribution by rko radio pictures before rko made a deal with disney only worth seeing if youre an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when,negative
well unlike most people i went into this movie expecting it to not be that good and it turned out to be an awesome film pretty cool plot i love the idea of it but what really made this movie was the actors they all did an incredible job and it was pretty cool to see fishburn and dillon work together its a movie where you go in thinking right away you will be able to predict whats going to happen but it doesent quite turn out how you predicted i dont want to give away anything about the story so i wont but i suggest giving this one a chance if you saw the movie money train and enjoyed that you would love this movie maybe everything lawrence fishburn touches is gold,positive

it was a fascinating story waiting to be told fat man and little boy takes us inside the trials and tribulations of a group of top american scientists handed a lofty task during the second world war beat everyone else to the atomic bomb sequestered in a heavily guarded new mexico compound the brainiacs slowly turn the idea from ambitious concept into immense realityfat man and little boy is one of those films that requires your close attention its a real thinking persons movie not only from the scientific aspect of developing a seemingly impossible weapon but also the moral implications of contributing to killing on a massive scale characters are constantly torn between that reality and their wartime duty as americans the film is never preachy about however leaving us free to marvel at the enormity of the inner turmoil these men face the performances deserve special mention as well paul newman delivers one of his great understated performances as the pattonesque general in charge of delivering the ultimate big stick for the allied forceswhere fat man and little boy loses much of its traction is in the unnecessary romantic component dwight schultz as the leader of the scientific team struggles with his affections for his family and his relentless obsession with his big project director roland joffe apparently felt the need to explore the more human angles of this story but the romantic overtones serve primarily as a distraction besides its the interaction among the scientists and their military hierarchy that give us the greatest insight into the thoughts and feelings of these brilliant menstill its difficult not to recommend fat man and little boy its a largely forgotten gem that puts a human face put on one of the most intriguing stories in human history,positive

i saw this film at the toronto international film festival i loved this and not just for the obvious reasons blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of mount everests sister peaks now this kind of thing is usually a cant miss inspirational moving pretty standard right and even if the film were just that id still have liked it but it was so much more blind herself german sabriye tenberken established a school for blind children in tibet in a culture that sees blindness as a curse as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives and at best are a burden to their families as part of their education tenberken shares with them the story of american erik weihenmayer the first blind person to reach the summit of mount everest she sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students instead he comes up with a plan hell arrange an expedition for them to climb foot lhakpa ri and provide all the guides and equipment sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun startseriks team are mostly american mostly male and mostly sighted as experienced mountaineers theyre type a personalities very gung ho and goal oriented sabriye is european female and blind and the students for her are more than a project no matter how well intentioned additionally the students are tibetan and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves as the expedition unfolds they become pawns in between the two adult sides wanting to please both while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment as an additional obstacle other than being blind that is they are speaking english as a second or in most cases a third language and struggle to understand and make themselves understoodwhen it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience and that some are much more coordinated than others it begins to unravel eriks original plan for them all to reach the summit together as both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults at the risk of oversimplifying on one side are those for whom the destination is all and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey i wont tell you how it all turns out except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought provoking stories ive seen in a long timethe film also weaves bits of each climbers story into the narrative and this was sorely needed since once on the climb the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut with all the drama going on around them that wasnt surprising the backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking and i found it very strange that i found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end this was contrary to my expectations and another pleasant surprisein addition to all the human drama to cover director walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen deprived conditions herself lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it wouldnt break down as with all great documentaries the filmmaker was just lucky enough or smart enough or prepared enough to be at the right place at the right time and shes captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do whats best for the kids as it does about the kids themselves,positive
this was very energetic and well played show i saw it back in and my friends and i still joke about it each time i watch its always as funny as the first i also love the way that everyone can relate to it in their own particular ways i am very much looking forward to seeing more of johns own scripts and productions unfortunately i cant find it anywhere for sale and ive done quite a lot of looking if anyone knows a website or store to refer me to i would very much appreciate it as i am looking for his other live performances as well please send me a message if any of you have info on the subject thankyou,positive
i just saw the movie in theater the movie has very few good points to talk about kareenas beauty and a couple of songs may be thats it the movie is a complete disappointment in all areas anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed even mumbai indians too just now chennai has made it to semi final but the worst i feel about the movie is the action scenes now days bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from hollywood but they forget that hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real but unfortunately bollywood directors do not have that much of time they spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie now such too stupid action scenes may work in south as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people but in bollywood this is certainly not going to work all the action scenes i wish i could have forwarded at the end even some chinese people appear from nowhere to beat akshay kumar this is height of stupidity audience is not paying to watch such stupidity i think bollywood now should forget about the action movies they cant make it the last good action i have seen was from ghatak and khiladiyon ka khialdi the current scene in bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me does these people see their movie after completion cant they figure out that the slow motion action which is done using ropes is too unrealistic and childish better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it i just want to go back to amitabhs era where movie like zanjeer and deewar were having thrilling action scenes the sound effect was not very effective in those days but visually it is much better than current era scenes this movie now should open the eyes of the bollywood movie directors please dont make any more action movies until you acquire the art of making it realistic,negative
a man is pulled off a london street and taken to some foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect dull banal film bored the hell out of me more an idea then a film i was half way into this minute film when i realized i had no idea who anyone on screen was it was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all of the ideas and put them in one place with out the real notion of character certainly its well acted with passion but there is no emotional center there is just an everyman of sorts which the filmmakers feel is enough its not and while the story presented id in theory important as a warning the film is too dull to convince anyone of it especially if one has seen the other better films of a similar ilk rendition with reese witherspoon for example,negative
alfred hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time one film that tends to get somewhat lost under the vertigos and the psychos is this film strangers on a train the most compelling film that hitchcock ever made the story follows guy haines a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the senators daughter if he can get a divorce from his current wife one day on the way to see his wife he meets the mentally unstable bruno anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall and one that could ultimately cost him his lifethe conversation aboard the train between bruno and guy is one of the cinemas most intriguing and thought provoking of all time what if two people swapped murders thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime and rendering their motive irrelevant could this truly be the perfect murder what makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that guy is lead into could happen to any normal everyday person everyone has someone theyd like to get rid of so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his the chances of it happening are unlikely but its the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of strangers on a train and in this situation anyone could is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of bruno anthony any better than robert walker the man was simply born for the part he manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in the character of bruno is a madman but hes not a lunatic hes a calculating conniving human being and robert walker makes the character believable his performance is extremely malevolent and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality unfortunately robert walker died just one year after the release of strangers on a train and i believe that is a great loss to cinema nobody in the cast shines as much as walker does but worth mentioning is his co star farley granger granger never really impresses that much but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against walker also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person and that is how it should be ruth roman is guys wife to be she isnt really in the film enough to make a lasting impression but she makes the best of what she has alfred hitchcocks daughter patricia takes the final role of the four central roles as barbara the sister of guys fiancé she is suitably lovely in this role and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is inalfred hitchcocks direction is always sublime and it is very much so in this film there is one shot in particular that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses this is an absolutely brilliant shot and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene hitchcocks direction is moody throughout and very much complies with the film noir style the climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting and i dont think that anyone but hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film its truly overblown and out of turn from the rest of the movie but it works there is a reason that hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time and the reason for that is that he doesnt only use the script to tell the films story but he also uses to camera to do so as well strangers on a train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made its story is both intriguing and thought provoking and is sure to delight any fan of cinema a masterpiece,positive
this multi leveled thriller kept my attention throughout it is disturbing and informative to see how perverse human behavior can be it is also instructive as to what past wounds can motivate present behavior no one save sandra bullocks partner is very likable however all are believable sandra did an excellent job her character cassie comes alive with all her pain and fear and defenses she is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment i enjoyed this movie very much tom landers,positive
what a disappointment ive enjoyed the jon cleary books about scobie malone but theres little resemblance between him and the cinematic malone in the books hes a city detective who is devoted to his wife and doesnt get involved in fisticuffs for the film the character has been spiced up into an outback copper who uses his fists and isnt averse to jumping into bed with a gorgeous girl though quite what she and the films other sex interest see in him i dont know taylor was at the time and his face was getting puffybut his characters stamina is remarkable he flies in from australia apparently goes straight to the commissioners house rather unwisely seeking to arrest him during a black tie reception saves him from assassination getting into a fight in the process goes to a casino with one girl leaves with another and takes her to bed so much for jet lag on the way back to the commissioners house showing a good knowledge of london back streets he gets beaten up by the baddies but is still first down to breakfast its also remarkable that the commissioners limo has its windscreen and headlights miraculously repaired within minutes of the assassination attempt and that one character has a touching faith in the precise timekeeping of a clock activated bombthe best thing is joseph the butlers disdain for the uncouth malone and at least the film avoids being a london travelogue though some scenes take place during the wimbledon tennis week,negative
a vg brit rom com one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy quirky and often surprising this is not the best of bradys films kiss kiss bang bang is by far the funniest though it does have a unique charm well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high you know from the start how its going to end but when it comes it is honest and very open ended a realistic and credible ending the end seemed like a beginning enjoyable and left me wanting more,positive
i was referred to this movie by a friend i had never heard of it but i thought it had christopher lampbert so i rented it and come to find out that wasnt christopher lampbert it was thomas jane who was great it this film i love that almost the whole movie is set in this suburban house the characters were great everyone of them and the script was amazing i really wish skip woods would write and direct another movie in my book thursday is the flawless tale of this guy trying to do the wife and kid thing after a shady past but then his old drug dealer buddy shows up and it becomes quite the thursday this is one of my favorite movies and it shows some real potential in thomas jane but this movie is very rare but i have found it in a couple of hollywood videos on vhs so dust off the old vcr and pop in thursday because it gets pee wees seal of approval,positive
unfortunately due to a sluggish start i cant say that this is one of hitchs best films it very excellent none the less the film stars jimmy stewart and doris day as parents who get caught up in a political assassination plot and must try to get their kidnapped son back they both give excellent performances not surprising of course really however i was most impressed with hitchcocks amazing use of music the climax at the opera house was fantastic and using a live orchestra to create music and suspense at the same time was pure genius absolutely fantastic suspense came out of that scene also the use of doris day singing que sera sera was excellent especially when it is transposed on scenes at the end of the film so this film to me ends up being hitchcocks best use of music that i have seen to date unfortunately it had a slow start or i could have recommend this film a little more highly even then it is still well worth a look out of,positive
i was looking forward to seeing bruce willis in this especially since i remember being mesmerised by the original when i was youngthis movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and dumb it down until its just another formula ridden hype of the fabled american law enforcement system army vs the russians no sorry the cold war is over make that with the russians vs the terrorists similar to probably other moviesfurthermore it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots the choice of weapon is well plain ridiculous are we seriously expected to believe that the worlds most feared and experienced hit man terrorist would select that for an assasinationthe whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellects between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who crafts a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away none of that survived all we have is the tired old american cia fbi army vs the evil terrorist plot weve all seen times beforebut of course the movie companys mbas realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them revenue from the short attention span gang so the answer is bruce willis big explosions and a crippled plot they assume the american audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesperson where is france on the map afterall so it has be an americananother example of a movie defiled by the boardroom,negative

it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time this movie simply oozes psychedelia influenced late s italian cinema so pseudo serious and sexually free sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander surely at her very best looking the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the mimosa towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings it might have been better if philippe leroy didnt look quite so odd with his fraying red hair and twisted facial expression he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different this is certainly that,positive
while not exactly offensive the version of the perils of pauline is certainly moronic the title might lead you to expect a tribute to pearl white the original pauline in the silent episode serial but for that you would be better served by the version starring betty hutton this version is like a mix of casino royale and the weakest of the elvis movies worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotch taped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles what unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of pamela austin pauline and pat boone george steadman a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills imagine mandy moore playing opposite dan quayle austin would later play opposite john aston in evil roy slade with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch in the mid s she was the dodge rebellion girl as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations imagine sandra dee in a dark blue jumpsuit when the automakers ad agency replaced her with the dodge fever girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film what story there is here begins with pauline growing up in the baskerville foundling home run by the actress who played mrs chatsworth osborne sr on dobie gillis george falls in love with her pauline not mrs osborne and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted george leaves to seek his fortune and year old pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich middle eastern prince when he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril these include african pygmies a year old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year old grandson is old enough for marriage the movie industry and the russian space programall this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part there is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under cranking of a camera which speeds up the action unfortunately everything else film stock production design editing is depressingly s nothing here even approaches the images of pearl white strapped to a log moving toward a buzz saw or tied to railway track waiting for the approaching trainthen again what do i know im only a child,negative
this was probably one of the most well made films of the s warner bros at the very height of their style the photography by sol polito is arguably his finest achievement gorgeous compositions and lighting with delicate shadowing max steiner contributes one of his most complex and beautiful scores the epitome of his classical leit motif method the music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is exquisite and memorable its interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went right on to make now voyager later that year a fine film which won honors and awards and went down as a historical favorite ciefly because it starred bette davis in my opinion the gay sisters is a much better film better made in all departments and more interesting complex and enjoyable a most unusual film which entertains those who take it for what it is rather than project their own modern creative sensibilities or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper critical perfection each thing has to be judged in its own time reference and for what it is trying to achieve on its own terms most of the complaints ive read in these reviews are so childish and totally missing the point if youre hungry for a perfect filet mignon dont go to the bakery counter and start whining and complaining about the fluff pastry the art of film criticism is truly lost on a large segment of the population sorry folks maybe if this movie had had a score by the rolling stones and a hundred intricate and soul searching subplots youd all be gleefully gratified ill take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions an day of the week,positive

buffs of the adult western that flourished in the s try and trace its origins to the film that kicked off the syndrome of course we can go back to howard hawkss red river or further still to john fords my darling clementine but if we want to stick with this single decade then it has to be one of a couple of films made in that eras initial year one is the gunfighter an exquisitely grim tale of a famed gunslinger ringo facing his last shootout another from that same year is winchester and its worth noting that millard mitchell appears in both as grim mustached highly realistic range riders in the gunfighter hes the town marshal expected to arrest ringo but once rode with him in an outlaw gang in winchester hes the sidekick to jimmy stewart a kind of horatio to stewarts hamlet in this epic tragic tale the plot is simple enough stewarts lonesome cowpoke wins a remarkable winchester in a shooting match beating the meanest man in the west stephen mcnally who is actually his own brother and caused the death of their father when the brother steals the gun stewart and mitchell go after him in a cowboy odyssey that takes them all across the frontier meeting up with both outlaws and indians in one wonderful bit two future stars rock hudson and tony curtis play an indian chief and a us cavalry soldier during a well staged pitched battle dan duryea steals the whole show as a giggling outlaw leader while shelly winters just before she began to gain weight is fine as the shady lady who ties all the plots together today filmmakers would go on for about four hours to bring such an ambitious idea to the screen but anthony mann does so in an extremely economical amount of time with not a minute wasted such western legends as bat masterson and wyatt earp terrifically played by will geer make brief appearances adding to the historicity as well as the epic nature the final battle between good and bad brothers high atop a series of jutting rock canyons is now legendary among western buffs its also worth noting that stewart however much associated he became with western films does what is actually his first western leading man role here yes he was in destry rides again eleven years earlier but was cast in that comedy spoof because he seemed so wrong for westerns,positive

the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts demons named brother dominic francesco carnelutti is found dead cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier heath ledger is contacted by top brass cardinal driscoll peter weller who asks him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominics death along with his girlfriend mara willims shannyn sossamon fellow priest thomas garrett mark addy alex travels to italy to delve into his mentors death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a sin eater someone who absorbed others sins lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully that the church wasnt happy about his activities alex must do whats right even if it goes against what he believesalso know under the title the sin eater this american german co production was written produced directed by bian helgeland didnt really do that much for me if im honest i usually am honest that is anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but its throughly predictable excruciatingly dull boring really silly at times it takes itself far too seriously the whole concept is daft while it thinks its clever with its oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious lazy way to end things theres the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief prophecys blah blah blah you know the sort of thing then theres the twists which arent hard to see coming theres the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clichéd hollywood ideals themes that get reused every time it deals with the church the order has nothing new to say as a serious piece of film making it sucks a lot im not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to as a die hard horror fan i didnt see much horror in this at all as a thriller its less than thrilling as a mystery its too predictable theres nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as its as exciting action packed as the average episode of sesame street present harsh maybe but its what i thinkdirector helgeland does an ok job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme it all looks a bit drab grayish dull for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there arent any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason dont ask forget about any gore or violence as there isnt any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable according the imdbs trivia section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they arent exactly brilliant as it stands nowi was amazed to see the order had a budget of about which is a hell of a lot of money i just cant see where it all went apart from the sets production design which are good the whole film looks feels very average utterly forgettable the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul mouthed comic relief irritates a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than thisthe order i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of its intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as im concerned is a pretty dull way to waste odd minutes of your life so dont do it not recommended,negative
the film heavens gate was a good view although still tedious at over hours but the film took great license as usual with hollywood james averill chris christopherson and elle were actually married in real life their main contribution to the johnson county war was to start it by being hanged well by starting it i mean it came at the beginning not the end heres the real scenario james averill and ellen watson were secretly married because one homestead could be given to each family by filing as single individuals they could get two homesteads they chose homesites on crazy woman creek actually controlling the water above the land held by a powerful member of the cattlemans association he offered to buy them out repeatedly which they refusedalthough characterized in real life as the owner of a brothel cattle kate and a prostitute herself and also in the film there is no real evidence that was true it is known that she bought many head of sick cattle nursed them back to life and was later accused by the cattlemans association of receiving the cattle in trade for lewd acts in the end she was accused of rustling an act almost certainly untrue so much for this part of the myth of the american west which is a gooble de gook of myths spanning a time period of about one hundred yearsin real life she and jim averill were surprised one day by several members of the cattlemans association taken in hand and promptly hanged those perpetrating the injustice were never brought to trial but that was the first link that led to the murder of nate champion and the start of the johnson county warquite different from the hollywood version which shows her shot at the end other than that i think the main problem with the film was the editor who could have made the action a faster pace by more skillful editing,negative
i loved kolchak the night stalker since i saw it on the night it premiered on september i loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by gil melle hey wheres the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level when darren mcgavins carl kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would he finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode its rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force hes usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are in one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself hes heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldnt do but that doesnt mean he probably wouldnt much rather someone else did it instead of him hes a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter he just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesnt want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do if his plan to defeat the creature didnt work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what i would do in the situation thats why i was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him you were scared for him and for the other characters too the producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but its all for naught if you dont care about the characters darren mcgavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue i can tell you i mourned when this show was canceled when i was a kid but as an adult i can see why it couldnt go on in that formula for very long i still love the episodes and two movies that starred mcgavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but good hearted reporter for the ins known as carl kolchak i seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why i loved the show its not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients the secret to its success is right there in the title kolchak the night stalker without mcgavins lovable bumbling carl kolchak to root for and to care for then it just aint a night stalker,positive
first of all this is an art film and a good one at that i loved the presentation and way it was shot very cool certain scenes were some of the more graphic horror sequences ive ever seen this film did scare me not because of suspense or shock but because i was deathly afraid that id soon see something really appalling that did happen in a few places but mostly at the beginning this film also dragged and the minutes seemed long however if youre into film you have to see this to date ive seen nothing like it,positive
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise it details the life of an year old boy in a small town in cuba in and during the revolution not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boys father the majority of the film is the boys coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to a class a film with fine acting and directing this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists it is a film about people and their lives their mistakes and their triumphs a good film worth watching several times annually,positive

what symbolism exclaimed a woman as we exited the theater after viewing the polish brothers paean to ingmar bergman some symbolism is there all right but not much northfork adds up to some fine acting weakened by dreary cinematography that fails to make any coherent statement and a muddled story that irritates rather than enthrallsnorthfork is a town facing extinction after a new hydroelectric dam goes into operation its the early to middle s and a squad of identically dressed state agents all looking as if they had just answered a casting call for the untouchables have the job of relocating recalcitrant dwellers who fail to appreciate both their immediate peril as well as the proffered bounty for moving an exciting anti development movie is always a possibility but lets get real rural electrification is one of the greatest advances in bringing decent living conditions and a boosted economy in american history dams can be built without forced relocation not in this countrybut this film is less about the plight of homeowners than it is a fantastical creation of a dying young boys escapist imagination nick nolte is the priest who tends to the lad and much of what he says might have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hearalternating between the black suited evacuation agents working for lakefront land when the dam creates that valuable acreage and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly the cinematography is poor a washed out subdued and depressive color permeates the whole film to little dramatic purpose there is no reason for this vast terrain to be depicted so bleakly indeed a contrast between largely untouched natural beauty and the massive and grim solidity of the evolving dam and power plants would have been very effective,negative
there is not much to add to what others have already commented the movie fails hard where it shouldnt it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievableone thing that got me thinking was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it the guy inside the truck with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out and then get back in without being noticed by anyone because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better that they could have gotten into from therepromising but not quite there,negative
lets get one thing straight this was bad so putrid that it doesnt even qualify to be imprinted on anyones memoriesthe ever repeating storyline whos constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances a typical storyline goes as follows sue the mother opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful as if that doesnt get old har de bloody har some australian quasi nationalist bogan look it up appears to say how she thinks shes awesome because shes an ozzie while everything everyone else that isnt sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode a small mercythe rest of the plot revolves around the father gary getting in some kind of disagreement with sue and him talking to members of his band for advice on how to sort it outthe phrase words fail me is an old one but this is where it is the most truthful thing to say it is so incredibly bad so horrible that i would like every trace of its existence sent to the lowest depths of the north sea and life can go onit saddens me though to see someone as good as sally bretton good actress i like her make a prat out of herself ardal o hanlon my hero aside has the ability to be pretty funny but not here and ben elton distinguished for so much good stuff somehow manages to come up with thisthing then comedy is in very serious trouble,negative
this movie is s l o w spent most of the movie actually waiting for it to beginthe setting was bleak the script was bleak the cinematography was bleak the plot was bleak the budget was low not that all low budget movies are bad but this one had no redeeming featuresthe plot was more consumed with a vengeful slightly deranged hunter than the actual wendigo which made a very brief appearance toward the end of the movie this in itself was disappointing as this wendigo was just a bizarre mix of a tree and a stag everything about the movie was uninspiringthe parents of the little boy appeared to be rather aloof and at times seemed completely detached from their son whether this was down to bad acting or a bad script im not sure but it only heightened my disappointment and boredom levelsthere was no food for thought nothing to pique an interest with no real intrigue or chill factor this movie creaked along so painfully you just couldnt care less what happened by the endwendigos ambiance reminds me of the dull movie shown at the awards ceremony toward the end of mr beans holiday a movie which is artistic and nonsensical trying too hard to to be deep and meaningful but coming across as pretentious and boringi would never want to watch this again i only watched it to the end in the vain hope that something interesting might happen but it didnt,negative
this movie is truly amazingover the years i have acquired a taste for japanese monster movies and am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor however this one reaches a new low as it follows the adventures of johnny sokko a young boy who controls a giant robot and his fight against the evil gargoyle gang who seem to have an endless supply of horrid giant monsters at their disposal,negative
although the concept of a year old woman portraying a year old girl might be a stretch for todays sophisticated audiencesin the s this was what the fans of mary pickford desired and expected from their favorite star the opening scene displays annies tomboyish character as the apparent leader of a multi ethnic street gang in comic battle with a rival group the sight of a young girl being socked in the jaw and kicked may be a bit crude but the scene is played in such an our gang fashion that it would be hard to take any of this seriously anyway annie can dish it out as well as take it once annie returns to her tenement home and replaces her street duds with more girlish attire it becomes more difficult especially in close ups to imagine this beautiful young woman as a street urchin however for those who can muster the required suspension of disbelief the rest of the movie has its rewards vacillating between comedy annies gang puts on a show to sentiment annie plans a birthday surprise for her irish policeman father to tragedy her father is killed on his birthday the film gives mary ample opportunity to display a range of emotions that would please her fans of any era of course the requisite happy ending is eventually achieved the evildoers are apprehended with the help of annies friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding down a busy thoroughfare on a sunny day which is a good a way as any for a mary pickford movie to end,positive
im not surprised that this film did well at the hamptons film festival it is a shallow film that would appeal well to shallow people two actors pretending to be actors in a relationship who fight and look for a lost dog the film is allegedly exploring the dynamics of the relationship however the relationship is far too petty to merit any such exploration this couple has one dimension they fight they tease then they make love and fight some more there brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason that these two would be involved with each other given their venomous and volatile relationship beautifully shot excellent score but without anything of merit in the script or characters this short is just that,negative

if you are looking for a movie with beautiful shots of mount everest then you may enjoy this movie just skip ahead to the views of the mountainspoiler alert however if you like me believe that lives are precious and not to be wasted then this movie will leave a bad taste in your mouth people died sherpas and a member of the japanese party just so that one man could attempt to ski down mount everestthe question is raised in the movie about whether the continuation of the expedition to meet his personal goal was still worth the cost in lives and he answers an emphatic yesthe part about skiing is in the last minutes he skis for a short time then falls the rest of the way until he comes to a stop in the snow,negative
i watched the movie about yrs ago while living in airlie beach qld australia i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most dont bother to browseto my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection i still do not have it but will one dayi like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy the semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effecti have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre with nothing but praise it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to comei fully recommend this film but only to those that are into this typethis comment and the one from laca can assist you when choosing to watch this film the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the derogatory connotation,positive
i really liked this movie of course the idea is pretty much out therethe federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small time thief to lure a more dangerous thief computer hacker out of hiding but alvin sanders the man who the feds have volunteered to be implanted with the device is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good humored but passive or one dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem definetly worth a watch,positive
i think this programme is a load of rubbish all they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting these people get paid lots of money for this and most of them cant even act to save their lives also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes i am bored with it i like the way that harry hill takes the mickey out of it on his tv show tv burp eg the weak joke the princess and the pea isnt exactly shakespeare is it that had sonia and naomi in stitches i dont see how that is funny i think this is a waste of everybodys money for their tv licence so this can be shown days a week isnt there anything better than this,negative

the only reason the duke is tops one of several race movies made during the times of segregation would be worth noting today is because it made the film debut of a year old singer named lena horne she plays ethel andrews a singer who has to leave her producer mentor duke davis ralph cooper in order to branch into the big time davis however has to fake having taken the money for her services in front of her so she wont feel sorry for having done so he then teams up with doc dorando lawrence criner for a series of medicine shows throughout the south meanwhile in new york her new producers have bombed big time because they made her the whole show instead of simply the specialty act davis finds out from the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his lineup of other specialty acts many of whom make their one of their few or only film appearances here for his chance at the big time with ethel next to him guess what happens while the plot is the kind youve seen in thousands of other movie musicals during this time the fact this was made for a certain audience makes this one of the more fascinating features ive seen during this black history month ms hornes singing is on good display here and its interesting seeing her so young before her professionalism takes full hold later in her career among other supporting players theres an unconfirmed according to imdb appearance by lillian randolph annie in my favorite movie its a wonderful life and sister of amanda randolph who i just saw in the musical short the black network as the woman with sciatica who complains of not being cured after taking the docs medicine before duke explains its for the feet and as a longtime louisiana resident id like to take note of two players from here in this movie joel fluellen from monroe as a tonic customer and marie bryant from new orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax so for just lena horne alone the duke is tops is worth seeing at least once,positive
this is a great film from reading other reviews i can see that im not the only one who shed a tear tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable in the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny one would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors the script is so wonderful i can see why they all wanted to be in it if you watch the long long list of credits at the end youll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason the soundtrack available on cd is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film my only complaint is that i almost didnt want the film to end,positive
the college girl murders is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace and generally my first real acquaintance with krimi films in general and i can say that im moderately impressed this stuff is really entertaining although i never would have expected it to be so goofy the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot with a healthy dose of humor flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings theres some james bond type of evil mastermind who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison theres also a villainous monk with a whip dressed like a communist kkk member getting rid of the leftover characters like overly curious teachers and such as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach seriously if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy i would have purchased a whole collection of them already the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow but i dont care because it was sublime entertainment even the funky s soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time its like a variant on the italian giallo but with slapstick elements,positive

i have recently watched this movie twice and i cant seem to understand why the hll the makers made this pile of crap i mean yes it gives a great impression of hitlers environment and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late s wwi and the inter war period what i cant understand is why they pictured hitler as a pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak he was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that but why in heavens name portray him in this way all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever yes he threw germany into the devastating nd world war yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war all true but again why the hell did they plain lie to the public to warn usi absolutely dont think this movie was a warning the true danger of hitler and the nazis was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive not to mention austrians and a lot of other people makes it a warning to modern civilization not the fact hitler was such a weirdo if it would have been like the makers make us believe i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader not to mention reichskanzler,negative
paulie sounds like the most saccharine lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find yet its actually much better than you might expect the daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film but actually in most other departments the film is charmingin case youre wondering paulie is a parrot bought for a little girl with speech difficulties paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her he even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker himself however paulie is sent away by the little girls mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from nyc to la to be re united with herso why does this awful sounding film succeed relatively well firstly it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects secondly and far more significantly it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline thirdly it has several surprisingly strong performances including jay mohr as a wily crook gena rowlands as a kind old lady and cheech marin yes the dope smoking cheech marin as a musical immigrant it might not be a classic but paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages,positive
a charming movie enhanced by the musical and vocal background especially during the competition my understanding is that there was never a soundtrack but could you through your sources advise me where i might get information on the singer and the likelihood of getting a copy of the song he sang your help would be appreciated the song really touched me and my wife and we would like to secure a copy wherever possible so that we might play it as background music when we have our family and friends over for our italian nights if you are able to get this information to us we would be eternally grateful even if you can advise of the studio contact so that we might go directregardsjohn payling,positive
directed by jacques tourneur cat people out of the past night of the demon and written by phillip dunne how green was my valley anne of the indies is a quite interesting adventure pirate movie its main character of captain anne providence is based on a real woman pirate anne boney who actually lived and sailed through th centurys atlanticthe film begins with the sea battle where annes jean peters pirate ship attacks a trade ship that was on its way to europe from the south america as a result a treasure of great value is captured along with a handsome french officer pierre la rochelle louis jourdan who is taken prisoner anne ends up falling in love with him and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but its only till she sets him free when she discovers that he has a beautiful young wife molly debra paget with whom he pretty much in love with anne begins planning revenge on both of them but in an unexpected twist of fate ends up making a great sacrifice in order to save them instead the pirate movie cliché figure of black beard also makes his appearance here this time played by thomas gomezthough anne of the indies probably appears to be no more nor less than a revisiting of pirate movie clichés it still has its classical moments in beautiful visuals and sea battle sequences filmed in technicolor as well as in some aspects of the story and most of all in personal touches in directing of all of it by jacques tourneur,positive
so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic tear jerking barbra streisand film something like the way we were i was certainly wrong the chemistry between the two main characters esther hoffman and her john howard was nonexistent making it impossible to get attached to the characters there wasnt anything romantic about it streisands character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldnt sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast forward button at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later theres nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who cant seem to realize it until he actually dies parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on and i kept asking myself when it was going to endthe death of john howard was completely predictable there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever it wasnt a tragic accident it was him basically being an idiot not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beardthe only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs the ending of the movie when she sings with one more look at you watch closely now was my reason for giving this film a whopping those minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger,negative
this homemade horror movie tells the story of a dude who kills people using the motif of stories by edgar allan poe the local police have bungled the case for a few years so now the fbi has taken over they know exactly who the guy is but apparently no one has thought to swing by his house because thats where hes hanging out running around in his vintage clothing and torturing the random locals so fbi chick gets kidnapped which involves her father the former lead investigator from the local police to top it all off a pack of wacky college kids have decided to camp out at the house and smoke a bunch of weedmostly the fbi agent winds up shrieking and running around like a little girl and not a single one of the burly college boys thinks to just stop and take a swing at the wimpy poe boy mostly overacted and sometimes underacted dead end road reeks of a low budget cast with friends production that has silly points too numerous to cover,negative
an insomniacs nightmare was an incredibly interesting well made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main characters subconscious without coddling the viewerthe acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i shot this on my camcorder look to them but this director knows what shes doing the lighting the cinematographyquality work im looking forward to a feature length work from tess nanavati,positive
this movie was beautiful it was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter it would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve i was totally involved in the storys unfolding and presentation there were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film the only complaint i can conjure is there wasnt a ton of details however this movie wasnt created to explain every element of joseph smiths life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing american and historical religious figures of all time,positive
this is the only movie that my wife and i have ever walked out on totally sucked we saw it in omaha even not funny at all looks like a year old kid wrote the humor i cant believe these real politicians were actually in the movie awful,negative
when i think bollywood i think of lite feel good musical dance numbers with gorgeous outfits on the men and women and catchy tunes horror thrillers mystery and suspense dont come to mind though and this to my western eyes is like an abstract comedy i think it would have been a better movie shorter even if the writer and the director had made a definite choice either gone for outright thriller horror comedy mystery supernatural suspense or musical romance instead of an awkward mixture of them all ill have to say more than once i thought the director must have seen i know what you did last summer and tried to give it a bollywood twist my first film was bride prejudice which i thought was acted well this seemed like what a western audience would consider a straight to video cheese festthe acting was over the top at times it felt like they were intentionally trying to parody western thrillers but when you saw them try to inject the dramatic crying screaming or fear it felt out of place the viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would wink at the camera more than a few times when the audience was supposed to be horrified we could only snicker a the absurdity i watch a lot of foreign films and even though i dont know hindi i have to say they did a poor job subtitling the film sometimes it was difficult to read the white lettering against the bright background the villain was particularly amusing at least to me because he came with his own mood music the supposed surprising twist actually felt like a cop outthe lead couples were handsome pretty enough and the musical numbers made it worth my rental fee id suggest it to someone as a musical comedy but id tell them to just fast forward the rest of the movie because it wasnt worth the effort of reading if youre determined to read a whole subtitled hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama namasteay london but i was not scaredunless thats really what they think is horrifying in india out of for what its being touted as out of for its unintentional quickness ability to illicit lots of laughs and its musical dance numbers enjoy,negative
strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over appears to be an interesting take on beauty and the beast it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and eracorsets castles rutting horses rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods proof that no one had a brazilian in the s and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at what more could you possibly wantit certainly brightened my sunday afternoon,positive
bugs bunny accidentally ends up at the south pole while trying to vacation in florida where he meets a little penquin which he tries to save from an eskimo this short tries and the penquin is adorable but in the end its a bit too light in the laughs department the eskimo isnt really that great of a foil for bugs and i just seen a lot better bugs bunny cartoons frankly even other shorts when hes paired with other unknown antagonists so i cant in good conscience recommend this one however it is nice to see it in its uncut form this cartoon is on disk of the looney tunes golden collection volume my grade c,negative
ostensibly this is a z grade dtv horror filmbut with lines like its easy to die i have many timesandwhy are you reading that book because it makes the plot more interestingandyou made your way in here now you can make your way out again after he leads a man into the basementand take a listen to what they chant its not that clear what this film made in the era known for post structuralism is actually about or whether its just bad film making the acting is atrocious but some actors i know so are they hamming it up an old house cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling is the site of murders a bad film is made in the grounds and the story replays again,negative
spoilers ahead if you want to call them thati would almost recommend this film just so people can truly see a where to begin well start from the topthe story dont believe the premise the movie has nothing to do with abandoned cars and people finially understanding what the mysterious happenings are its a draub basic go to cabin movie with no intensity or effortthe screenplay i usually give credit to indie screenwriters its hard work when you are starting outbut this is crap the story is flat it leaves you emotionless the entire movie the dialogue is extremely weak and predictable boasting lines of woah you totally freaked me out and i was wondering if youd uhif youd like touh would you come to the cabin with me it makes me want to rip out all my hair one strand at a time and feed it to myselfthe characters holy crap some have described the characters as flat i want to take it one step further and say that they actually have a reverse character arch they actually start working on a parallel universe and almost start acting backwardsthe actors worse than the characters are the actors they take already poor written characters and add in terrible high school drama acting the woah you totally freaked me out was said so monotone and slow like it was dumbed down i could complain for hours on the actors alonetechnical lighting an eight year old would be disappointed with lighting on this movie too shadowy in areas too bleached in others the director shouldnt use light as an emotion until he learns how to light a basic scene properly baby steps sound how many sound guys does it take to make a really shotty sounding movie with that many sound guys this should sound amazing but quite the opposite has occured there is one scene in particular that really sticks out these guys are driving in a car and the sound of the car changes with every camera angleweak camera learn to use itanyway im running out of complaining spacerent it i dare yourent it and learn from itgive it a ratingit deserves itsigning off amanda christmas,negative
i am a fan of ed harris work and i really had high expectations about this film having so good actors as harris and von sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do i really think that needful things is the worst movie of harris filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake anyway ive seen much worse movies in my life but needful things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent the story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake i dont know if that is because of the book cause i havent read it but if the script was so bad i cant see the reason for filming it maybe it was the commercial success of kings books or the need for low quality movies for the vhs era of the s whatever the reason was though this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved,negative
first off let me say if you havent enjoyed a van damme movie since bloodsport you probably will not like this movie most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but i enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are this movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys segal and dolph have thought about putting out the past few years van damme is good in the movie the movie is only worth watching to van damme fans it is not as good as wake of death which i highly recommend to anyone of likes van damme or in hell but in my opinion its worth watching it has the same type of feel to it as nowhere to run good fun stuff,negative
i am puerto rican and this is one of the worst documentary of ive ever seen of any type you can see that the people on it are clueless they dont know much about puerto rico and its culture they claim to be puerto rican because they are from puerto rican descendants but they probably know less than others who are not from there you can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves if you would like to see a real and i mean a real genuine documentary from puerto rico then you must see mi puerto rico thats a serious real documentary not like this piece of junk rosie perez based this documentary on herself i thought it was suppose to be about puerto ricans they keep repeating i didnt know well thats about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary i hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the island it brings down the standards,negative
this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment its about a cat that has used up of its lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time hence the name fraidy cat fraidy cats previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different eras in time and are constantly trying to kill him off but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number and spits out lighting bolts very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy i watched this movie almost every day as a child o,positive
for the main criticisms of the movie the love story that wasnt a love story those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy it added a feminine touch but come on look at american moviesno where close to love story there was no storyline does war have a storyline i think that is a silly criticism the storyline is this they start with men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about men and how each did their part and died death is the ultimate end to any story just because there was no happy ending doesnt mean it has no storyline there was a horrid truth in this movie i wouldnt necessarily call it anti war it had a political statement of course but the movie wasnt all about the politics in fact except for a few occurrences when the captain showed up there was never a stifling air of nazi germany they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party the fat cats werent gonna go into russiamaybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier id say exactly of almost any nationality and warand what they must go through it was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing and to the person who said that it was gutsy and silly to even portray germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you thatthis movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary a few problems with it when arguing for just one but it instills the best of both worlds watch it as such beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically emotionallyim waiting til they make a movie about iraq it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial i want to see who has the guts to do it first jarhead doesnt count,positive
let me start by saying overall i enjoyed the long kiss goodnight i would give it a the good acting samuel l jackson is entertaining in almost any role in this movie he doesnt play his usual character the type that is in control instead geena davis is in control and sam is along for the ride his timing on his lines are great and he is the high point of the movie geena davis also gives a great preformance as samantha caine charlie baltimore she is a believable action hero and i dont think too many other actresses could pull off the preformance geena does the action this is a very action packed movie things are pretty much always crashing or blowing up or someone is chasing someone else the special effects are pretty good especially for being almost years old i can see some green screen stuff but it doesnt detract too much from the actingthe bad why did it take half of the movie to set up the plot this film needed to be edited in the script stage so that it didnt run as long as it did maybe a drama or something can run this long but people really need to be into the movie the entire time to sustain it i think that if you can stick out the first half you will be pleseantly suprized the second half geena davis is cold weather and a tank top but she never seems cold some things are unrealistic sam jackson flies through a giant sign after he is blasted out of a room and then he lands in a tree and just gets up when you see this part you will think its a gag overall fun movie,positive
the secretary is one of those cheesy cliched thrillers that one is subjected to watching on a sunday afternoon when there is virtually nothing else on while the plot a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them may be one of a kind i recognized countless plot twists probably taken from other tv movies that i had been subjected to for the very same reasonto make matters worse i was not wild about the cast mel harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many tv movies as either a mom or some sort of victim of foul play or abuse that one must wonder the kind of life she leads in this one she gets the joy of playing a mom and a victim of psycho secretary sheila kelly who was not a very good choice as the villain while sheila kelly has made some good career movessingles breaking in and i guess law and order she is also beset by a string of pitiful tv movie roles and this one just adds to it as for the others i dont have any clear memories of them so that must say somethingthis one will play on the lifetime networki think thats where i saw it but dont bother watching it unless you are too bored for words not that it will make you any more excitied,negative
like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously id like to know what moron actually read the script and went yea this is it this is the next film we are going to green light and whoever that person is should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script well id love to give you my email address and maybe youd like to just give away some more money this film is atrocious in every waythe wayans are funny at least they can be they have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way but in here not only does the premise defy all logic not only is the acting terrible not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find but they actually want you to pay to see this film maybe if it was freenaaah it would still be a waste of timeusually id be inclined to write some long winded detailed review about why this film is so bad but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking this is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack makes my top ten list of worst films of all time,negative
im sure that operations dames was a favorite at the drive ins back in the day theres absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied and if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the moodotherwise there aint a whole lot that operations dames has going for it its set in the korean war where a platoon of gis together with a british tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the un lines bad enough already but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of uso girls and their choreographer in the same predicamentyou know whats sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the army and in combat situations these bimbos from the uso set womens liberation back light years in fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pantsbut that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive in for this no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effortoperations dames is definitely a team flop,negative
i saw this one remastered on dvd it had a big picture of sandra on it and said starring sandra and made it seem like she had a big part in it not so shes barely in it she does what she can with the script but thats not much the sound was awful by that i mean things didnt go together shots would be fired and the number of shots didnt correspond to the sound people talking in a car while its moving and the shot is from outside the windshield but theres no motor noise road noise or any other sound kind of weirdscore was awful it sounded like the same few notes over and over dialog really awful acting was awful i couldnt believe any of it fight scenes were like a batman comic without the biff and bam they were really lame the shooting scenes i mean with firearms were laughable literally i fast forwarded through a lot of this movie even then it was too long,negative
my take the silliest of the airport movies and probably one of the worst of the s disaster moviesas if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to airport throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements in its attempt to be the biggest airport yet concorde airport is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the s with its bad box office results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcomethe film opens with a rather catchy score by lalo schifrin backed up by some impressive shots of the titular aircraft in its former glory the same plane used in this film would be involved in a crash in july but then the credits appear and we get a glimpse of the all star cast which is composed nothing more of faded hollywood stars tv actors and none too popular b actors the plot is sillier than ever george kennedy is back in the role of joe patroni now the pilot of the concorde co piloted by co pilot alain delon en route to france after the summer olympics on board is reporter maggie whelan susan blakely who has just discovered that his boyfriend renowned weapons manufacturer kevin harrison robert wagner is selling their weapons to terrorist to prevent her from revealing the news to the world harrison sends his most advance missiles and best saboteurs to prevent the concorde from landingthe cast subplots are dumber than ever even sillier than an alcoholic myrna loy or a singing nun we have cicely tyson transporting a live human heart in a cooler martha raye as a woman with a bladder condition and the character doesnt go deeper than that jj walker a a pot smoking saxophonist arguably the most annoying character in the film eddie albert married to old wife sybil danning avery schreiber as russian coach with a deaf daughter and finally a love story between reporter jon davidson and gymnast andrea marcovici much to the sour watching eye of coach mercedes mccambidge plus the movie gets much closer to love boat episode than ever with the silliest cameos of charo and her pet chihuahua and bibi anderson camp buffs will no doubt get a real kick in the balls in this silly entry in a long strain of s disaster movies this one is in more than the sense of the word a true disasterrating out of,negative
just watched this film on tv and it was awesome had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyablewould recommend watching it,positive
this movie kicks ass bar none bam and his crue have out done themselves with this film since i got the dvd days ago i have watched it three times and it gets better every time i watch it i cant wait for grind to come out in theaters if its anything like haggard it will be worth the waitthanks jtcellphone,positive
this is one of those movies thats difficult to review without giving away the plot suffice to say there are weird things and unexpected twists going on beyond the initial superficial tom cruise screws around with multiple women plotthe quality cast elevate this movie above the norm and all the cast are well suited to their parts cruise as the irritatingly smug playboy who has it all and then loses it all diaz as the attractive but slightly deranged jilted lover cruz as the exotic new girl on the scene and russell as the fatherly psychologist the story involves elements of romance morality murder mystery suspense and sci fi and is generally an entertaining tripi should add that the photography is also uniformly excellent and the insertion of various visual metaphors is beautiful once you realize whats going onif you enjoy well acted movies with twists and suspense and are prepared to accept a slightly fantastic philip k dick style resolution then this is a must see,positive
dear god i kept waiting for this movie to get started then i waited for it to redeem itself and when it did neither i just sat there dumbfounded that it could possibly be this bad and that i had just wasted a couple of hours on just sheer stupidity i had faith that drew couldnt possibly have made this bad of a movie and boy did i ever lose my faith dont bother with this one drew tried but the movie was poorly written poorly acted and just poorly conceived i cant believe a script this bad ever got funded it had a million chances to actually do something with the idea the word concept is too big for this movie to even qualify for and it still didnt go anyplace its just pitiful where the other reviewer got the idea that it wasnt the worst baffles me because believe me if it got any worse id have slit my wrists before finishing it,negative
this is not the stuff of soap operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life a testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding,positive
i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features first off the film is undeniably cheaply made with its cardboard sets limited settings and creative scientific props the acting ranges from very poorthe two strippers barely professionalherb evers as the leading man gothic overstatementleslie daniels as the assistant kurtto first rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancees lustful passions the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be this film is a thinking film in many ways however dont be too fooled by its real intent it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriends head with the perfect body thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties,positive
spoilersive heard some gripe about the special effects but that should detract from the movie the movie is a suspense film and its very good at that so from that stand point this movie rocks franke rocks enjoy to ones plastic hearts content so no complaints for this movie unless you watch the english dub which is a total farce it creates the illusion its a b movie one complaint i do have is the music video on the dvd it doesnt say who sings it id love to know quality entertainment replayable,positive
ok i have been a huge fan of the black for a long time and was disgusted after seeing this film lets name the problemsfirst this film has much of the same crew that the first two had it has also been called the prequel to the original black stallion why is it that they cant get shetans dams name correct or her color in the black stallion returns we learn the sagr was the blacks chestnut mother and in this film she is a gray mare name jenny wtf and its set in africa in and i could be wrong but the first one was set in the s as well when the ship wrecks time line doesnt sound quite right to me also as a goof there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be shetans fatherupon further notice it appears to be a gelding ben ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way might be a cute family film to some but its my biggest movie disappointment of the year,negative
i dont see much reason to get into this movie in much detail sylvester stallone is once again john rambo author and survivor of a season in hell recruited from prison by his only friend major richard crenna to secretly return to vietnam take photos of the american prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemyfat chance what if he actually did nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out who would come to see the movie its essentially a celebration of stallones muscles preparing for his mission we see his well oiled muscles bulging they are oiled and bulging throughout there is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives the black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as stallones muscles the bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemys forehead the knife is sharpened with slick snicksstallone and one of his pows are betrayed by one or two of the suits from washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school no guts you know just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beerthe movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious it deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid s that there were uncountable numbers of mias quietly kept in wretched camps by the north vietnamese the bumper stickers were ubiquitous free our mias why would they keep them it was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the pows into a slave labor force in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the united states a propaganda weapon that the vietnamese kept secret from the worldas a captive rambo is treated in a medieval fashion by the north vietnamese dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display then not content with subhuman vietnamese a russian officer is brought in to play the part of the gestapo officer vee haff vays of making you remember a high tech type the russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dumprambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that vets returning from vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why i guess we elected so many to the congress and appointed others to high echelon positions the last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group at least rambos aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apacethe action movies with schwarzenegger and willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but rambo is humorless it marches dully through its phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak to speak is a sign of weakness,negative
michael jackson would have claimed a spot for the top billed character in the golden child and because he loves kids that didnt work and why should it so instead we have eddie murphy out to save the world by rescuing kid midas i would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actors inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy adventure comedy thats a step closer to ishtar whatever murphy says or does can be best liked but dont get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent he doesnt belong in this movie and the same went for dr dolittle the violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldnt have made any sense as hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of ronald reagans presidential fame murphy is far better at coming to america and hrs but this stale movie isnt my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste,negative
kirsten dunst is terribly overrated as an actress you can tell always shes just acting i like izzard though plot is awfully boring the viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least you can see each plot turn coming a mile away what is this movie supposed to be comedy drama who cares you wont by the end of this film,negative

this movie is funny funny funny my favorite quote from the movie i think i saw a half naked indian in my room last night response that was no hallucination it was a indian in your room and another is what the hell are you talking about just what the hell are you talking about but if i ever be admitted to an hospital like this one i will be prepared to write my will on the spoti would say there were in my opinion three very funny characters in this film most funny but three is the funniest to me even though their lines were few and dont get me started on the crack pot patient hehehe that one i will keep secret and fast paced too,positive
when you look at mexicos best movies you will more than likely find that the photography was performed by gabriel figueroa he is recognized in the world as one of the best that have ever existed his master control of the cameras gave an added asset to the movies he was part of if added to his participation we add the direction of luis bunuel you will never find such a pair of aces anywhere else in the world this story nazarin was written by spains greatest writer besides miguel de cervantesdon quijote de la mancha the story in itself is superb nazarin a priest that lives by his beliefs tries to live a very christian life but as always there are people that do not accept this he wanders through many places preaching his christianity but finding most of the time people that do not accept him but besides the splendid story it is always interesting to try to interpret the enigmatic messages that bunuel sends us throughout the picture in scenes that make you shiver,positive
this short is one of the best of all time and is proof just like most of charlie chaplins work that sound and color are not requirements for quality work in fact this cartoon uses and may have started some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years like caricatures of celebrities including the afore mentioned chaplin while the characters are silent they do speak by use of word balloons just like in the comics given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip this device is a natural the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension literally and figuratively and makes this short a delight to watch well worth taking the time and effort to get most highly recommended,positive
now i had the best intentions when watching this one i like some of tony scotts work also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie even though i heard otherwise from other people but this was simply hopeless in my humble opinion tony scott was trying too hard it was all just too much allow me to elaborate miss knightley was overacting and not in a good way the people who did perform well were mickey rourke edgar ramirez and christopher walken but their screen time just wasnt able to save the movie there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer a certain tune was used around times which really started to bug after the second time im a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once also the editing really went out on this one as the cutting rate is rather high oh and the repetitive echoing of some of keiras lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second third fourth time and so on basically my opinion is that if you want to see an action flick that is high paced and somewhat funny and you dont care about everything i mentioned above you might like it on a side note im not a keira knightley fan,negative
if you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on dvd it was probably delirious you were looking for how often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines i was too young to see richard pryor during his greatest time and when i was old enough to see eddie murphys delirious and raw not as funny i never knew where eddie got a big part of his inspiration now that im older and have seen both pryor and many of the comedians after murphy i realize two things everybody steals from eddie while eddie lovingly borrowed from richard thats the huge difference eddie was original funny provocative thoughtful and more he was something never before seen he was all we ever needed these days eddie murphy is boring and old but once upon a time he was the king and delirious was the greatest castle ever built truly one of the funniest routines of all time,positive
yet another example of the complete waste of uk lottery money just how commercial did this film prove the film council who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded on one of the london undergrounds disused stations for allowing this clichéd dismal specimen to be committed to film a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate most notably deathline amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute its a little bit too late then surely all those development executives at the uk film council could have noticed this at the script stage add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare,negative
at least during its first half if it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes it would have been a much better and tighter film the second half of the film is worth it especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early th century ships but its like a dull toothache getting there also dont watch this film just because ginger rogers is in it she has an important role but its a small onethe film starts out showing three new york city buddies working the tourist trade and also in good natured competition for the hand of sally ginger rogers a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue world war i breaks out the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle yet enlist in the navy anyways the one of the three with the least industry as a civilian bill boyd as baltimore winds up the commanding officer to the other two robert armstrong as dutch and james gleason as skeets to make matters more complex sally has fallen in love with one of the three but doesnt have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to warthe film is a little more interesting on board ship mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable however james gleason at age looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between and to be eligibleone real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design or i should say the lack of it in the scenes in new york just prior to wwi we have everyone dressed in the fashions of and everyone driving the cars of no effort was taken to bring this film into periodin conclusion if you watch the few scenes with ginger rogers in them and the last minutes involving the naval suicide mission youve seen everything here worth seeing the rest is padding,negative
there are just so many things wrong with this moviejeff bridges weird accentritas ability to crack the password code the entire script the ending esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for jeff and rita and the publisher j r laugh and say we dont drink coffee anymore well why did they order it then they obviously did if they didnt and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffeestotal tosh,negative
big fat liar in my opinion is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it when jason frankie muniz malcolm in the middle and kaylee amanda bynes all that played those tricks on marty paul giamatti doctor dolittle i really smiled and felt good thats what i liked most about this movie as a matter of fact everything that happened after jasons essay erroneously ended up in martys hands was hilarious i especially loved jaleel whites cameo when i first saw him i couldnt be certain but when i asked my mother if it was him she said of course before i wrap this up id like to say like i said earlier there is a moral to this story and that moral is always tell the truth now in conclusion if you are a fan of frankie muniz amanda bynes or paul giamatti i highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it,positive
for three quarters of an hour the story gradually develops towards a pivotal point of some sort although it is overburdened with scenes that just seem to be intended to dull the viewer and lure him away from the actual plot there is something happening it is not much and it certainly is not obvious the combination of palace impressions and story driving scenes do not add any depth or insight to the whole cast of characters in fact they keep them sterile as there is no character development at all everybody just remains spinning and centered around their own cliché and role the cute kinda headstrong girl the fighting überwoman the snobby aristocrat the male lead does not seem to have any distinction at all he is a shallow presence which actually doesnt even matter as he is only there because the storyboard required him to it seemed like he was on vacation and got caught up when the point comes of turning the corner in terms of what happening the movie first snaps completely blank for a couple of minutes and then becomes ridiculous it solves or better dissolves itself with a by the book deus ex machina more clichés and some of the most crude plot devices and choices i have ever seen its history alright first the movies a drama though its supposed to be comedic and then it turns into a farce the protagonists do what they are expected to do and there are no surprises the first set of somewhat serious antagonists however gets replaced by a couple that literally was just bored maybe that was some kind of nod towards the audiencethis movie does not get any bonus from me for underlying philosophical meaning since there is none nor for its technical realization the animation and editing is fair and sos the sound mixing but it is by no means outstanding or even above the average japanese productions of the late s in fact the visual treats seem static un inspired and un originalworst of all it totally fails to entertain even if you dont bother with characters and all that stuff theres too little going on here and the rest is corny at best get a real ghibli instead have a feast with it and keep your fingers off this one,negative
all ambiguity about michael myers has withered away thanks to this series chronic habit of arseholing about with its continuity and pulling relatives out of nowhere this entry introduces the potty angle that hes not just a psycho killer but is actually controlled by runes which appear as a star constellation every halloween and a cult is using him to erm well this film is far from coherent and i lost track of the plot after a while the movie hemorrhages credibility so profusely it doesnt have a drop left by the end why does michael put one victims clothes in a washing machine why does an otherwise empty corridor have a deadly spike sticking out of the wall does getting electrocuted really make your head explode and so on its left to donald pleasence in his penultimate film role to produce some wonderful little moments from the pile of dreadful dialogue hes given,negative
let me say first off i didnt go in expecting much and watching it at prime time on opening night should have helped i believe it would have had there been more than people in the theater it sucked so hard the acting was robotic at best and nothing was really explained until the last minutes of the movie i guess that was their way of twisting the plot keep everyone in the dark on crucial info to understand the movies direction until the end and then explain things and hope it feels like a twist of plotunknowns until the end of the movie what the eff is a dark ling the cg was cool but i want to understand why cant powers be willed especially if mass murder is the ultimatum why is willing away powers so bad your just normal after right who fartedroughly of the minutes with just men on screen were shots of them in wife beaters sleeveless ts and then a gut wrenching pool scene of all teenage men in the skimpiest low riding speedos knowing to ever have been manufactured i swear you could see the start of the one guys well it was close to soft core and of course there was a shower scene and to mix it up it was of the dudes butt cracks were abundant a sausage fest in progress but there was a single girl shower scene in which nothing was seen and she ambles around the best looking dorm bathroom for around minutes then there was a girl talk pj party the other thing i couldnt get over was the amount of driving that caleb did in his super cool ford mustang gt it was a ford commercial for around th of the moviedont see it or go see it with a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies then it could be worth it but dont expect anything breathtaking,negative
bland is probably the word id use to try and start describing this film i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let downbasically the film is about racism in a post america and the director went at it with a sledge hammer there was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of magnolia feel to the film which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start raining frogs at the endall in all a huge disappointment,negative
this was far and away the worst movie ive ever seen in my entire life it was slow boring not scary not funny not dramatic not entertainingsarah michelle gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock she couldnt sell her character nor could anyone else in the picturefor those who thought the grudge was kind of alright then dont go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your lifei saw this movie for free by the way so i dont want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost bucks on a terrible movie it was free it still sucked i hated itavoid,negative
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle he made a series of low budget horror films in the s s that he sold with gimmicks in ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in bw the tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle actors in his movies and his daughter it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy the documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting its very short under minutes and theres never a dull moment a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans my one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures that aside this is just great,positive
cause its crap the kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say why horrible camera workcount the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and cant the dialog is ridiculous the acting is comical it looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible id bet they used home video cameras to make this either that or most of the cameramen were drunk truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie if you ever want to host a worst movie party bring this one want more entertainmentstare at a wall,negative
i gave this a four purely out of its historical context it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early ninetiesmoe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo spade cooley has a couple of numbers i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch im not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy even the stooges seem to be going through the motions overall theres nothing much really to recommend hereif youre not a stooge fan then dont bother if you are a stooge fan then stick with the shorts,negative
i dont hand out ten star ratings easily a movie really has to impress me and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hoursfrom the moment that the opening title appeared i knew we were in for a ride paul greengrass has done it again everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera however for me that last one was never a problem i think it adds to the suspensei will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd simply because it is genius it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy,positive
that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful oscar winning performance one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxxs performance in ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar i would laugh right in their faces who knows maybe hes better off sticking to drama because if you watch bait its clearly evident that comedy is not his forte i swear jamie mugs so much in this movie that im surprised his face didnt fall off and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesnt require being loud and obnoxious if a joke is funny its funny if its not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character in real life normal people dont always have witty comebacks and quips like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver its important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model if a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken and wouldnt the police try to scold him if he was there are many scenes like that throughout the film another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent not funny not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether its the right time for it or not im not even a big mike epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to jamies as a matter of fact this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more low key approach one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality however fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly over the top as the villain a big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile also playing a heavy antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day even in bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another unless youre a die hard fan of foxx please dont take the bait,negative
i dont know if it was the directors intent to make sure the sky was almost always sunny and beautiful in this film perhaps that is the romantic image many americans have of the time this film is set as it is in the middle of the war macy has returned from the war his neighbor asks hey is it true you got a fritz over there and is trying to get on with his life but one day he gets a new pair of glasses hence the name and sees things clearly as the surrounding situation reveals itself to be one of rabid anti semitism and macy and dern could wrapped up in it funny how neither is jewish in this film but the accusation is made also it is historically accurate as the labor union democrats of this time wrapped themselves in the flags of america and god macy is continually pestered to come to the meeting his presence brings unexpected resultsapplying this time frame to today is a study in contrast in has undergone a complete reversal with average citizens who have taken patriotism and religion as their unifier supporting the republican party and viewing organized labor as part of left wing unpatriotic americaa great picture to watch if you care to see the friendly timid and meek macy played beautifully by him get caught in the carnage of race and hate in the mid s in nyca tough emotionally charged film,positive
bad bad bad those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema and its movie in america what is this country thinking mike myers looking more like micheal jackson some chineese lady that falls asleep within minutes a lame plot with dirty jokes its grotesuque and awful when green eggs and ham comes out in ill be so happy not eddie murphy and tracy morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost green eggs and ham theyll try to chase sam i am and that mean guy who are running away with it i hope they dont ruin the classic book dont waste time and money by seeing this,negative
we dont know if darlene loves all three gentleman certainly they are wary of one another yet they live together viewers might surmise that the feelings of rivalry between the gentleman and the feelings of all of them toward darlene might make for an unbearable home lifein the eerily beautiful rural brazilian landscape emphasized by the frequent use of polarization and the use of kodachrome stock anything might happen and the alternatives for any one of them save perhaps ciro may not be alluring enough to encourage them to change their circumstances they seem to bear the intolerable because it is familiar the unknown frightens them into complacency toward a fate which is more challenging than their characters can utilize thus it crushes them rather than strengthening them the web in which they are caught is made of the sanguine filaments which bind us all perhaps the sadness i felt after watching this movie has to do with its portrayal of the inevitable fading of our youths bright colors in the unforgiving light of time the three children will enter the world fated to relive their parents lives to one or another degree well filmed and portrayed the story is tragic in its essence walt disney it aint,negative
poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original setups it uses the same closet under the bed person behind you in the mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a foreshadowing way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed at least not on screen which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticketits a horror film w o any horror lmao the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheetyou have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were high drunk at the timehonestly i have a life and dont bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendouslybut this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins its another when you have to sit through it in a theateralso in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a re imagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimedit is just stale and booooringhere is what you will take away from this film remembering the scar on brittany snows head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with js cardone of the forsaken to have gotten another role as a killerbecause he is as frightening as my poodle and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow doesnt show up this is my warning to you do not waste youre money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude but once you see this you will understand why i say what i say,negative
havent seen any of the japanese grudge films but i really enjoy this one i rarely get scared when watching films i can jump if the effect and sound is startling enough but getting scared from a movie is a rare thing for me but i did get scared from grudge maybe because i didnt expect anything at all when i watched it i didnt expect getting scared i didnt know anything about it either that was probably a good thingthis is a film that you apparently either love or hate most people seem to compare it to the japanese grudge films but even though i havent seen them i believe it isnt right to compare any film actually this film stands on it its ownthe story is weak most people say i dont agree the story is minimalistic and done so on purpose the story telling techniques used the broken time frame for instance is perfectly done the director knows exactly what hes doing and i believe he got his vision through as he wanted iti gave this film of it is a film you will enjoy watching or hate its as simple as that,positive
the couch trip is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the s in this case dan aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist and he goes to beverly hills to sub for charles grodin most of the movies humor springs from their satirical look at beverly hills and peoples empty lives there a woman has a power struggle with her maidits the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time dont expect any kind of religious experience but youll most likely laugh a lot at how the beverly hills people flaunt their wealth also starring walter matthau donna dixon arye gross and victoria jackson of uhf,positive
listening to the directors commentary confirmed what i had suspected whilst watching the film this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie the plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when theyre going through that i could write a book screenplay award winning sitcom phase theres a germ of an interesting idea buried in there probably because its a sequel to some one elses movie but it is totally buried under an underwritten badly executed and laughably un thought out scriptthe lines are dire and the performances are un engaging though again im inclined to blame the director he does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required rather plonked the script in their hands pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it who knows with a little coaching these actors could have acquitted themselves better say what you like about musicians in movies jon bon jovi was excellent in row your boat and more than acceptable in the leading manas it stands the cast have no chemistry whatsoever a beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when in order to infect bon jovis character with vampire blood from his ailing co hunter he is given a transfusion she should have bitten him mind you they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too the only real moment of sexual tension between the two female leads is by the directors own admittance accidental he had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition so i suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse but not a lotfrankly as movies go this is badly plotted silly and forgettable even as trashy movies go its not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining it could have been a fun and bloody little romp but the director has left with more of a comedy for all the wrong reasons,negative
another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late february the details are given in an addendum that follows this reviewthe film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non observant jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughters non jewish fiancé leave the housethe distressed daughter hannah maria schrader then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then years old had been taken in and protected by an aryan woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena fischer now hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too patthe film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same mrs fischer at played magnificently by katja riemann a baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to fabian martin feifel a jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the rosenstrasse sitethe narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color saturated the scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tonesthe quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in germany and the direction of margarethe von trotta new german cinemas most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actressthe story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positiverosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual raps it is too long but i found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were detained i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depictionthe very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the somberness of the film stayed with me afterward i awoke often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating b seen on if youd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websitesadd the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the final roundup in the national capital to jews mostly men married to non jewish women were herded into rosenstrasse a welfare office for the jewish community in central berlinbecause these jews had german relatives many of them highly connected adolf eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied polandnormally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the east but before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever growing numbersperhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the third reichjoseph goebbels the gauleiter governor or district leader of berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nations public morale on both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the womens actions rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the final solution goebbels with hitlers concurrence released the rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty five of them who already had been sent to auschwitz to both hitler and goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable but they were mistaken almost all of those released from rosenstrasse survived the war the women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction adapted from an article posted at the university of south florida website a teachers guide to the holocaust,positive
kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if youre rich then youll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita at first their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father daughter relationship one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really never go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right the only problem is the annoying visual style which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because im sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like its been possessed by demons i wouldnt have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when its spread through out the whole movie then thats when we have some problems the same annoying style was recently used on domino and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images somehow williams wrote some decent music for the movie but im sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience it rather makes you feel like youre being punished the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it i dont know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart if the end of the movie doesnt make anyone cry then theyre dead on the inside denzel washington breaks his rule of not making any action movies with this movie and luckily for him he gets to play a great character the whole idea of a man thats lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge radha mitchell plays marc anthonys wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i cant hate the movie too much jlos husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesnt really stand out much mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie a little too late for that if you ask me lets hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this,positive
i read john everinghams story years ago in readers digest and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it as far as im concerned landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the little house book series is proof the acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of landons puss than should be allowedthis movie reflects everinghams story as much as little house on the prairie reflects the books is was based on its just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair,negative

boston legal has turned its tail and is headed for the barn door and th pig slop it has created when this show first aired almost four season back it was a humorous slap at the legal system which all actors seem to take pride in portraying it was funny diversified and to some extent factual the characters portrayed were acceptable and to an extent real in their portrayals the sexual comment and activity were limited and humorous julie bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated but is now dragged to the lower depths of media programming of sex and violence julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this production rene adjurdubois is an excellent actor who has from the days of benson to this production held his own in the field of entertainment always showing the humor and respectful acting of the production captain kirk is funny and humorous is candace bergan and is to be admired for her continuing in this production and is a good actress james spader there is no doubt in his acting ability however he should go back to his xxx origins such as crash as it appears he has much talent and inclination in that direction we ask that this series be trashed as it already is and its really starting to smell,negative
this movie is brilliant in every way it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way but never lectures the script never condescends toward any character not even the hapless johnny it also and benefits from spot on direction production design casting and performances the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my year old twin daughters and they loved it as well it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end,positive

i saw this film when it was released to theaters its definitely one to remember i had forgotten the title until recently a friend found it via online searchone dark night is rather unusual for the suspense horror genre of the time in that it contains no blood it is of the teen fright variety yet the teens are respectable in their own ways its a nice old school film with props and scenes that reflect the times our hero rides a motorcycle with no brain bucket for exampleas has been mentioned by previous reviewers one dark night is currently available on dvd the original negative was not available for the dvd transition some reel changes are a bit rough but this doesnt take away from the story that being said the colors are vibrant and the lighting is very goodadam west plays a rather smallish part in this film as raymars son in law his role as an overbearing and indifferent husband is thankfully shortthe story builds over the course of the film unlike many horror films of the era one dark night is a great suspense story that gives the viewer time to absorb what is happeningthe final minutes or so of one dark night are what make it so memorable raymars telekinetic abilities are used to open old graves in the mausoleum pull the coffins out open them and move the corpses around attention was afforded to great detail in the final scenes the rotting worm riddled corpses look quite real,positive
horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesnt always win out over imagination we all know that killers like freddy jason michael and even leatherface shouldnt be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day most of us dont believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains and lets hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them this is where imagination wins out over fact horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow this usually isnt a problem when i watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at george c scott or when i see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near burketsville but what i do have a problem digesting without wanting to regurgitate is when a film has a killer like the one in this film to give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that i actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed there are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is but the minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by john hough if the film would have offered me a different killer then i would actually be raving about it this may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with mejohn cassevetes plays dr sam cordell he and his daughter jenny played beautifully by erin flannery have just recently moved to this small new england town cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died we see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman one can only presume it is his wife is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed again i am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental there are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities it never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor john leslie and screen great james caan he has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice but he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene he just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him he never really looks like he can be trusted in this film i guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to cassevetes himself there was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get go the story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry there is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them when the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank once she is there she is attacked the young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in he looks frantically scours the room and spots his would be lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it it is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct notealso introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of galenthroughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped this is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement it just didnt strike the right chordthe incubus is a well done film it is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done i was intrigued by the dreams that tim was having and i was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders but when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth and bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones out of this could have been a nine too bad,positive
i like money i stumbled on this brilliant film in a local video store last week wasnt sure what to expect brought it home set up the player and then my journey in to stupidity began the first viewing i did a lot of chuckling no laughing out loud really it wasnt until the second viewing the movie really started to take a hold on me and the humor was that much funnier it reminded me of austin powers first viewing it was all right then the real fun began telling people about it just talking about each scene and the set up im making all my friends watch this movie everyone i know this movie may very well be one of the most accurate future movies ever made this movie is more then just minutes of entertainment its a warning to the future of our civilization mike judge the fantastic mind who brought us office space has brought us a vision of life in the automated future luke wilsons dead pan humor as average joe enhanced the movie that much more watch this movie then once youre done read more write more think more for the futures sake if not for your own,positive
this movie not a film clearly recorded on a cheap cam corder may be one of the greatest cinematic stink bombs in history beware the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex addiction the film is not an exploration of anything and it is no more erotic than staring at ones own warts the script is pointless and meandering with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes however even the sex scenes are lame lame lame except for the first they are around three seconds long then again maybe my version was cut and comically overwroughtif you are looking for a decent film you dont want this if you are looking for a titillating sex flick you dont want this whatever your lifes goals desires or perspectives you do not want to watch this movie how they got rosanna arquette natashia kinski and ed begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme,negative
if you like your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values then thisll work for you big time oversentimental in places sure of course it is and proud of it it is the biggest and best ride in the carnival and should be enjoyed as that big production values simple telling with creative shots it is not complex is a very nice and remarkably sweet film it really feels like a labor of love from bill paxton and i bet his son gets thatthe build up is slow enough to be enjoyed the conflicts feisty and the british vs americans handled with a degree of vaudevillian villainy but the dignity between the two main transatlantic protagonists is always to the fore i have minor gripes the score wants to be james horner but is too overblown and there are too many close ups and panning shots for but if you want a straightforward decent and good looking sports film then this is itso heres the thing and i feel like i know my film but i actually liked it more than seabiscuit which is a better film but greatest story is simply disney at its core and hugely enjoyable thanks bill,positive
this movie just pulls you so deeply into the two main characters i popped it into my laptop without even reading the cover let alone reviews and was intrigued for two solid hours two lost ships from two different worlds collide the sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact toward the end i couldnt decide which i wanted more our hero and heroine to pull off their caper or simply consummate their passion rml couldve done without a curious subplot and a traditional minutes would have been plenty im nitpicking though after a series of netflix blockbuster and local library duds this movie restored my faith in great film making,positive
the strawberry blond has a great script but i just wish errol flynn was in it instead of james cagney hes not the person for the part i do think olivia did a great job this movie is also a day dream wrap around so its hard to follow i dont like the male character attitude the way cagney presented it was just off i give it a for poor acting by main male character if you like tough ruff men that like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie the strawberry blond would have been better if the main character had more of a positve attitude and change the script so he is happy hes with olivathis movie points out money does not bring happiness women right jokes plain and simple not the best movie but every one must decide for themselves,negative
fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale big edie and her daughter little edie aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis they live in a rodent infested rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually the content is pretty much made up of two things the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer actress and dancer these discussions usually become very rhetorical nonsensical and often times amusing the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties each of course thinks their singing is perfect and its only the other who sounds bad in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus coming each day to record and chuckle at whatever bizarre behavior may come about ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable,positive

josh hartnetts dead eyes the thick writing of it and harrison ford being in a buddy cop comedy heres reasons to hate it avoid it and to utilize minutes of your life betterthe buddy cop movies are fun however their real golden age was back in the s and the s making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask god to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than hollywood homicidewhat really did happen to this entertaining formula since a whole decade the things hadnt been the same youd have a buddy action stubborn flop after another ill delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well i spy national security taxi starsky hutch and the worst of them all yet miami vice i believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and tv shows during decades already add to that particularly here the negligent dealing and the dull humor actually the matter this time is totally unbearable yes weve got the characters of loyal cops who have second jobs and the background of sinful city but what else was new its not about cliché its about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly madethe acting especially from hartnetts side is terrible this guy is anything but a comedian or actor so his character was wanting to revenge for his fathers death revenge on yourself man he probably died out of watching your acting even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy or thats what they seemed here anyhow the directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh some parts managed to be highly dull arresting the black guy through the lack its a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action comedy they didnt utilize hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm or even as a place whichs full of shining or fallen stars cameos that couldve given it few interesting momentsits a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars glamour and as being a buddy cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of stars with non chemistry on the screen one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself guess who and a buddy cop destroyer more than movie god dont make me or my children live enough to witness hollywood homicide part at last look at harrison fords performance he wanted to have a good time but at least we didnt,negative
anyone who sees this film will notice that the makers threw a lot of money at this film its interesting they titled it the hole the production values are good for a short film the hole tries to look big budget and does in some ways but is hampered by the video format it was shot on i speculate if this was shot on mm it would look incredible and would elevate the content somewhat many hollywood movies look good and thats enough for an audience regardless of story and contentmy honest opinion out of for this effort maybe ishimotos next film will deliver,negative
i knew it wasnt gunna work out between me and d wars from the moment we met first its title was lazy d war like writing out dragon was too much for them also you really cant be that blatant with your title unless your blue monkey blue monkey can do whatever the hell it wants the second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the storys insane progression heres the film dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks flashes back to a time he and dad wandered into what must have been the competition for the store in gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that glows old shop keep reveals several terrible truths that bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god tells the kid that hes a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in la is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness hes a year old asian fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose why continue on dear reader if you have the ballsso sarah the reincarnated lover has her own flashbacks i have the benefit of having an asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing its a korean legend and shes reincarnated from a korean princess but everything is in chinese later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt she calls the police cause it looks like shes having a heart attack see in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her shes locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims shes crazy i have a new phobia now and its that if im ever in trouble the first responders will just assume im crazy i have another point of contention with my harsh mistress dwar there is a scene when patrick dempsey jr dreamy reporter is in a café with sassy black friend in the scenes prior miffed near divinity bauraki has killed an elephant slithered through a suburb and killed one of sarahs friends see people were afraid to come out after happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for business as usual no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on if i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win after being given a satisfying dragon on helicopter battle my cruel lover dwar treats me to a pi and vinegar filled scene to end it all with bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under la i guess they dont really say but dreamy reporter and sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up yep dragon palace some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestle make love whatever and im not kidding good snake out of nowhere maybe you think im blowing it out of proportion im not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly there few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god sets baurki on fire sarah turns into a ghost and goes with dragon god dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits thank godnow our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times there was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars ill call him tuskan shredder he could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful he could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasnt helpful he could go in your dreams when that wouldnt do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered he was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry i like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises the actors for the most part were great if great somehow meant terrible jason behr whom i thought was awesome in roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and thats pretentious spacey and patrick dempseyishthe one thing i love about this filthy prostitute dwars is its lead actor bauraki that giant snake acted his heart out id dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi god of evil then john barrymore was at playing richard the iii or hamlet there was emotion in every scene stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast when he ate an elephant i felt like no one past present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling he was more then an actor he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project yes damn it my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake ive got the balls to admit that do youheres to hoping bauraki gets more work and isnt type cast that jason behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare and that i never have to watch blue monkey again so d war its over i want my cds back and lets just be friends,negative
youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sightsredas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he cant drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his sons protest to get him there in their broken down vehiclebut reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of palsthe beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differencesits perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destinationit certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are dont miss this and yes book early i was pleasantly surprised that this evenings session was still a full house,positive
for anyone who may not know what a one actor movie was like this is the best example this plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense its full of cliched situations hackneyed lines melodrama comedy you name itbut amitabh bachchan can make anything convincing and this movie is by no means an exception everyone turns in a decent performance shashi kapoor waheeda rehman ranjit om prakash smita patil but it is the megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence without him this movie would have been a non starter the story is about separation mistaken identities misunderstandings love hate loyalty good vs evil everything really amitabhs is a brilliant performance on all counts in an otherwise silly film and did i mention that it is ridiculously funny,positive
i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so its mr hall whos making a fool of himself not me am i being a bit cruel on him no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain dont have he has his foot in the door he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next he gives the audience more of the same young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate he is bullied at school and no one loves him the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer he has a macho waster of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days not come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who its trying to appeal to i have often criticised channel for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at am for example but they showed this at am and for once theyve got it spot on considering the story involves politics ballet dancing gawd i hate it lung cancer and poverty theres no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an year old child and features angels and ballet dancers dont blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them theres not much here for an intelligent adult audience either of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot,negative
i caught this movie on tv yesterday i had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by emilio estevez and starring him and his real life dad martin sheen i love to see a movie about a father son relationship that involves a real life father and son naturally theres an instant chemistry between sheen and estevez and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that theyre actually related of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors ive seen martin sheen in intense roles before but i think this is emilios most intense role being that i mostly recall him from the mighty ducks series and i was very impressed talent really does run in that family and kathy bates steals the movie in an oscar worthy performance she tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue kimberly williams the beautiful actress from the father of the bride movies is also very good holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors the movie is a bit stagey with dialogue thats obviously geared for the stage but that didnt bother me this is not meant to be an action movie this is a character study and for a film thats based on a play it never gets too claustrophobic when emilios character jeremy reminisces to his days in vietnam we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life the film is extremely powerful and realistic without being sentimental at the end i expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky dory but thats not how it turned out the ending made me cry without resorting to standard hollywood melodrama that proves reality is much more gripping than anything hollywood can conjure up if youre in the mood for a beautiful powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks offplease check out this underrated gem hopefully one day martin and emilio will unite with charlie and they will all make a great film together my score out of,positive

jack brooks quirks are at first somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this moviei found myself getting angrier and angrier as i was duped into seeing this one through to the end in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super tedious waitthe climax cant begin to make up for all the setup timenormally one might expect shallow characters from this genre but the fact that the wait time before action index is so high should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character developmentnot sowhile not without its initial charms this movie ultimately infuriates and disappointswish i could get all that setup time back to reinvest it into something that pays off,negative
probably the best picture producers releasing corp ever made this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last director frank wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and whats more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging pervasive fog this chilling atmosphere is augmented by wisbars inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players the lovely rosemary la planche makes an ideal heroine beautiful spirited yet vulnerable robert barrat delivers his usual no nonsense straight down the line portrait of the local bigwig though its hard to believe that the personable good looking guy who plays his son is none other than the later dullsville writer director blake edwards,positive
this movie is a warning to all people sat surfing the internet on a typical day at the office my warning is do not reveal too much about yourself be careful who you cross there are spies on this internet thing i thought that it was so scary what that man and woman combination did to poor angela bennett i did not realise that somebody could take ones life away in one click of this mouse angela i thought did a sterling job of outwitting jack delvin and that awful girl my question is why does that computer make that noise when it works like a clicking sound mine does not do this or this one this film also tells you that there is fraud on this internet also why couldnt angela do the virus destroyer programme at a cybercafe i also thought that like all computers the transfer rate to disk was slow that is correctly portrayed in this film when you save the programme to your floppy disk the bar only moved slowly i quite liked angelas house at the beginning of the film as well why did no one believe angela,positive

this movie was very funny with just a bit of gore it is about two grave robber that are going about business as usual when they discover that there is a different clientle they can serve this changes the direction of the corpses they collect the movie is told by the younger of the two as he is explaining the business to a priest before he is sent to be beheaded his partner had already been beheaded the priest is required to take down the last confession and it takes the form of a story there is some animation thrown in which gives it a tales from the crypt feel in the story we meet another group of grave robbers that everyone fears but at one point the younger of the two up for execution is offered a job so this calms some of the animosity between the groups when a woman joins the two men she oversteps her boundaries and gets them in trouble with the feared grave robbers the story leads up to the meeting of the two groups which led to the arrest of the man that is confessing and the man that has already lost his head,positive
first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel revelation matthew isaiah and other prophetic scriptures there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations as a christian though an amillenialist i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so lowno what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message but rather its lack of production values awful script mediocre acting and pitiful fx this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the s no this movie ranks down there with plan from outerspace this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequelthe apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this but they failed the left behind series the apocalypse series and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem but their scripts are still poor and their acting is woodenthere are great christian films with extremely low budgets but this film is not one of them im surprised the mstk crew never lampooned this one,negative
stay alive has a very similar story to some asian horror films which include technology on the storysome of this asian horror films are one missed callringu and pulsesothe idea of stay alive is very clichéd and obvious but the filmmakers behind it did not know how to put something new or interesting to the clichés in stay alivethis film is totally crapbut a very big crapall the elements of stay alive belong to the worst class of horror filmsshallow charactersnothing of suspensestupid horror which makes laugh and light violenceits easy to note that the director is incapable to create something original or disturbingi do not wanna loose more time writing about this pathetic filmi just give you an advicedo not see this filmi really hated it,negative
expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipatedit actually has a feminist storyline though i dont think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set it certainly wasnt practiced women and the jews and the poor are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society throughout the story sister flavia florinda bolkan witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just cant sit there any longer and actually does something about it albeit with disastrous resultsthe pre credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield she sees an injured evil muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him before she can her hate filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics huh after this her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice though scenes do involve violence rape and nuns i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation indeed many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there but the acting camera work storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level most nun films ive seen usually have the basic premise of a good girl somehow winds up in a convent where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and or make their lives a living hellflavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong spirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me but its a lot easier for guys sister agatha when a group of muslims attack their abbey flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns their attackers actually function as their liberators of the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey in fact it is a christian not a muslim invader that impales dear sister agatha it is agathas death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her her father treats her like dirt her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time i dont want to give out too much of the rest of the story but be prepared to be shocked devastated and saddened at the conclusion this is a great film so dont be put off by its undeserved reputation as a trash epic plus how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong i am not familiar with maría casares other works but sister agatha is a hell of a characteri have read many great reviews of the synapse us release but i love my german x rated kult dvd copy it isnt anamorphic but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapses releaseand there are also many great wise or funny lines of dialogue many from sister agathawhy is god male the father the son and the holy spirit theyre all male flaviathese men are afraid look at them sister afraid their power will be taken away from them sr agatha regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrivewoman where are you going the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians havent done ha ha ha sr agatha to a group of fleeing christian womenlord bless these moslems for putting fear into these pompous christians flaviadoes it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you ht your underclothing sr agathaclosing message flavia gaetani not yet a muslim no longer a christian was punished as a runaway nun the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the at otranto,positive
the fbi story was warner bros minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency from a book by don whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by richard l green and john twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by mervyn leroy however it did have splendid colour cinematography by joseph biroc and a helpful score by the studios musical magician max steinerthe movie charts the history of the bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent chip hardesty james stewart as he relates his investigative experiences in flashback to a class of budding young agents but its all very long winded and episodic and as it progresses it begins to look like a tv mini series instead of a major movie production as the young hardesty runs the american crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as baby face nelson ma barker dillinger etc to sorting out nefarious organisations like the ku klux klan nazi spy rings and the red menace and here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star the fbi story would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster moreover this is another problem with the picture stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own with the exception of vera miles who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife he is surrounded by a cast of minor players throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like robert ryan jack palance or even raymond burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever but nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs pitythe film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the bureau with the help of stewarts narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field and we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily choresanother plus for the movie is max steiners remarkable score heard over the titles is a powerful rousing and determined march while for the pictures gentler moments there is an attractive love theme but quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the ku klux klan sequence and better still is the rhythmic latin american music the composer wrote for the south american scenes especially the exciting fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the federal troops on horseback the fbi story was one of five scores the composer wrote in which included samuel bronstons naval epic john paul jones the charming rom com cash mccall delmer daves seminal western the hanging tree and daves a summer place from which derived the young love theme which was to become a major hit tune for steiner better known as theme from a summer placethe fbi story just about passes muster as a movie thanks to birocs rich colour cinematography steiners wonderful music and of course jimmie stewart who makes anything watchableclassic but implausible line from the fbi story as the bland nick adams who has just blown up a plane with people on board including his mother is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts in case i get any mail you can send it to canyon city prison for the next month or so after that you can send it to hell wow,negative
actor herman josé plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the benfica club of its heartfc porto therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the fc port was wronged with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and fc porto sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as portugal without great antecedents in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north south of portugal fc porto benfica highly recommended,positive

the english patient can rightly be compared to the films of david lean whose sweeping epics such as lawrence of arabia and bridge on the river kwai must have inspired the director anthony minghella the film is beautifully photographed and like lawrence is set in northern africa but during the second world war the story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by ralph fiennes and a married woman played by kristin scott thomas the story based on a novel by michael ondaatje is told in flashbacks by fiennes count laszlo de almasy the titular character the fact that his name does not sound like hes english plays a key role in what unfolds he has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in europe by hana an army nurse played by juliette binoche what makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill fated lovers the film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for if youre a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that the english patient speaks directly to you,positive
having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised reality check the original series wasnt that good i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy dukes legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment its amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first seriesback to the movie if you watch this film in its own right not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series then its not bad at all the real star is of course the general lee the car chases and stunts are excellent and thats really what doh is all about johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb and dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and mc gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p coltrane the way he always should have beenif you dont like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldnt be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect otherwise if you want an entertaining car action movie with a few good laughs thats not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind,positive
this is my favorite horror film a close nd to poltergeist i saw one dark night when it first came out in theaters in at the theater where i workedi was born in so i have a certain love for s horror films despite them being a little dated and the dialog not well written what i thought was so original about it was that the phenomenon of psychic vampirism has not been addressed at least to my knowledge at that time and is a very real phenomenoni didnt care if adam west was in it nothing against him but his supporting role was not memorable but thought meg tilly was good casting the little known donald hutton from brainstorm and invaders from mars as an ambiguous scientist who oversaw studies on ramars abilities was sadly overlooked as a gay guy i was paying more attention to david mason daniels meg tillys unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend hes selling real estate in texas now i felt the film realistic in two ways raymar who was discovered to have murdered girls in his surreal apartment had a funeral that was sparse in attendance reflecting the fact that not only was he mysterious a hermit but a killer as you know these types are buried without fanfare second if corpses were going to be telekinetically mobile they would hover dragging their feet the filmmakers could have gone for the schlock walking groaning arms out stretched zombies but opted for what would be believable kudos the buzzing electrical discharge from ramars eyes at his throne coffin like hes overseeing his kingdom of dead cast an eerie magenta light in the mausoleum that will stay with you for years if youve ever gone to a mausoleum even on a sunny day you will notice that they have their own rosetta lighting caused by stained glass windows dont get me started on the cavernous silence even ramar himself looked like someone who could pass as an eccentric perverted old man the score was one of a kind and memorable and i keep kicking myself for not getting it on cassette when it first came out the track shooting was done where it was supposed to be i especially liked the carefully planned characteristics of each corpse the bride the badly decomposed child still holding its teddy bear the grandmother the tall thin black guy and the half faced world war ii vet and the green slimed eyed elderly gent who was the first to greet the sisters clique initiators even corpses can be good actors i suppose the only thing i had to groan about was the arm that came out of one of the vaults and choke julies boyfriend couldnt possibly be done unless a corpse was put in laying on its stomach and feet first but why it looked a little to fresh toothe film begins eerie with us never seeing ramars face until the last quarter of the film which is like unwrapping a birthday present as he is picking up teen girl runaways in his daughters psychic flash we then see coroners hauling his body away in his one bedroom apartment where we see hes experimented his telekinetic craft by phasing dishes into his wall the rest does drag as the heathers like sisters group baits julie into a final initiation by spending the night inside the mausoleum but it is a well placed build up to the unleashing horror later the movie isnt bloody in any sense of the word the goriest part is when ramars daughter uses a compact mirror to feed his power back to him and he bubbles then melts ive always felt that a power like ramars could never die and a sequel could be worth looking into i can see it now one dark night ii turning in the grave but lets face it the film stands alone i heard the film had other titles but the original fitsa remake would be pointless but if there were to be one i would write better dialog and lengthen some scenes such as show the studies on ramars abilities done in the lab instead of hearing about it on a tape recorder in this information age something like that would be well documented on dvd and more corpses why just raise the ones in the mausoleum when ramars power could spread to the graveyard too lets just say id hate to be one of the persons who had to clean up the mess at the end of the climax something that too can be shown i think having one of the initiating sisters recognize one of the corpses as a relative would have added some good if disturbing character with cg effects some awesome scenes with ramar animating cremated remains would be off the wall say what you will aboutone dark night but it has it all so see at least once in your lifeor death,positive
many accuse rod steiger of overacting and anyone who has seen the amityville horror and the fly section would struggle to say otherwise that said hes brilliant in thisits never on tv you cant buy it on dvd legitimately in when channel still had a prescription for innovation they showed this amongst a small amalgam of s films privilege etc and i remember an essentially theatrical experience transposed well to film the great thing about theatre is its enclosed how do you make it available and interesting on screen ph just about pulls it off because this sort of film is never even on cable or sky tv anywhere its hard to get a debate going but for anyone out there who has seen it or can remember my memories are of a forthright almost strident performance by sally geeson thats all taken care of which eschews the almost diffident general performances of her and her sibling in many early s offerings she says ref conception there are several of these key lines you remember years decades on thats the power of a film like thisps i just saw it again and its just as good one day tv too will be enlightened,positive
from the very beginning i was so excited to see this movie the poster is possibly the funniest ive ever seen for a movie i immediately bought one for my dorm this septemberevery element came together in this movie so beautifully its not often you see a movie with so many penis gay and racial jokes so praised by critics carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie youre rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid the supporting cast is brutal each of them having some problems with the ladies themselvesone of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes were given this is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly this movie will often be brought up when the words chest waxing and condoms are mentioned in conversationwatching it in the theater i was surprised how many older people were there to watch it i saw a group of four mid s women come in despite an older audience this movie still filled the entire theater with laughteri think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the office and steve carell a lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes youd see on family guy too the movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged womeni dont recommend going to this movie if you arent a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended however when you are at the movie just remember this movie is all in good humor the jokes arent gay jokes theyre just jokes and theyre funny,positive
it seems to be a perfect day for swimming a normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising the woman barbara stanwyck takes the car and searches for helpjohn sturges short movie minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this there is a double question the movie poses how far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand observing stanwycks behaviors towards the stranger does she really love her husband like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself,positive
this production was quite a surprise for me i absolutely love obscure early s movies but i wasnt prepared for the last minutes of this story if by any chance youre not convinced in the first half hang in there for the finale of course you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical a fascinating viewing experience but i think the cats paw is not available on video dvd yet watch your pbs listings,positive
there wasnt a in the voting option so i was compelled to use the next available figureit is a sad day for bollywood when such type of movies which have star cast actors is nothing more are than a bunch of juvenile acting and an awful scriptthis movie is nowhere near to be called a clone of hitch salman khan with his usual take off you shirt theme and govinda with his in humorous laughs if somebody had told decades ago that i would be writing a comment on salman after his success with maine pyar kiya i would have written him her off,negative
must have to agree with the other reviewer this has got to be the worst movie let alone western i have ever seen terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the s and oh did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene and the ending the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the moviecompletely awful and yes it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable lets remember when shots when a main character dies luckily i saw this on free tv dont waste your time,negative
designed only to annoy or amuse any self respecting intelligent person if the directors intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but i know that there is no such thing as a hollywood director whod make a critique of americas pro marxist s movement especially not a filmmaker from the s there is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes i wondered if i wasnt actually watching a comedy you wouldnt be at fault for thinking that this is a satire thats how nave the movie appears spacek has been in her share of leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those hollywood liberal morons but i mean arent they all nice boobs but st for brains,negative
genius or utter madness that depends on your interpretation of this film i responded to it on the level of a self aware cop movie parody and i sincerely hope that was the intention as i dont see anyone taking it seriously d paul rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things is this film supposed to mark a departure for rudd from his core background in the comedy genre some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard boiled action star i think not with the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget fx and zany over the top action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old tv show sledge hammer for me hilarious of course i may have totally interpreted the film wrong if it was in fact an attempt at a straight action movie then it was certainly an amusing failurewatch with lots of alcohol and some mates,positive
what is there to say about an anti establishment film that was produced in a time of such colourless void social indifference and authoritarian contentment cassevettes first major independent film was not an instant box office success and still has not received the critical attention it deserves i draw comparisons to this wave of american independent projects consisting of such beat filmmakers as robert frank and harry smith with the burgeoning scene emerging in paris in the late s known as the french new wavethey discussed poetry and philosophy and vulnerability at a time when the rest of the culture was obsessed with rediscovering american cultural supremacy even at this stage this peculiar highly spontaneous brand of filmmaking fought against the establishment of such political lexicons and bigots that held the development of the arts in check in the mid twentieth centurycassevettes film examines race relations and portrays man as weak in the face of love because we as a culture are blinded by our own race bias and prejudice the great element to most of cassevettes work is that his films have almost a reversal minimalist effect a mental reaction is evoked through subtle character relations not so much imagery this is why his work seems to linger because he takes a more intimate approach to defining charcters that rely less heavily on explicit actions and more upon interpretationalthough my favourite cassevettes film is husbands this one is his most important,positive
anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series the borg does not come around until q brings the enterprise to the gamma sector the klingons are never seen until kirk encounters them the ncc was the first ship to carry the enterprise nameneed i go on berman and pilliar have made a mockery of gene roddenberrys creation after he died they only saw and just went their own way no wonder majel barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series i dont blame her for not being involved with this mess poor bakula hes a great actor as are the entire cast i like them all but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series just check the ratings i think more people watched deep space which was untimely canceled,negative
this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray reagans administration as incompetent and bungling some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but im sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone but i was wrong this time there are apparently many others,negative
one of the last films directed by lionel barrymore ten cents a dance stars barbara stanwyck as the dance hall girl barbara in her sixth role stanwyck looks quite plain jane in this one and opens with her getting chewed out by the dance hall manager then along comes rich guy bradley carlton ricardo cortez who wants to sweep her off her feet cortez and stanwyck had made three films together in the s then she meets eddie whos very different from the dashing carlton the writer jo swerling had worked on some biggies its a wonderful life guys and dolls and gone with the wind so i was surprised that the characters and script in this were so ordinary the story starts getting more interesting about halfway thru and is very similar to the bride walks out from also starring stanwyck tbwo is much more clever but also more tame due to on slaught of the hays code,positive
i swear if i did ever tried cocaine id be able to relate to this film perfectly its pace as well as the dialog churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their headsthere are great little elements that pop up through out the film like how rob lowes character seems to always be loosing a shoe or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path the story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawlessthe movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness this is one i think most could enjoy a few laugh out loud even if you are alone moments ensure that ill certainly be watching this again,positive
i like this film for several reasons i have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like topkapi i also enjoy films like topkapi and big deal on madonna street that spoof the the genre one of the best ones is disorganized crimecorbin bernsen has met four cons over the years and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small montana town but he hasnt given any details on the crime to the fellows nor do they really know each other at all shortly after he sends for them bernsen is arrested by two new jersey policemen ed oneill and daniel roebuck whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back while he is in their custody the four cons fred gwynne lou diamond philips ruben blades and will russ show up without a clue about why they are there except that bernsen was planning something the first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other with gwynne and philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other at the same time we see bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from oneill and roebuck again not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed the result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film the four cons trying to figure out what bernsens scheme was and how to put it into operation and bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of there is also a third smaller plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local sheriff hoyt axton against the idiots from new jersey who keep getting into his hairthere are many delightful moments in the film such as axton egged on by oneil and roebuck into surrounding a house in the town that bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of and yelling through a megaphone come out we have you surrounded only to have the scene switch to a huge montana plain that bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment there are moments of misadventures by our four cons who fortunately put the oldest gwynne into leadership position this does not always guarantee anything at one point their car wont start and they have to thumb a ride by truck unfortunately it is a truck carrying manurethe conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery including disabling all the police cars at the critical time philips specialty is cars is also a gem of timing suspense and comic results the film is very entertaining and certainly worth watching,positive
david attenborough brings his fascination of wild life this time the creatures under the sea in this extraordinary episode trip to all the animals under the seathe cinematography is astounding bringing to the screen truly breathtaking footage of those whales but the best thing about it as well as seeing each episode is how they made it whether it is making models of creatures or those impressive shots of the whales they explain to you in about minutes how they did it had some great tv shows to our screen but in contrast to this documentary gem they make them pretty lame but to even boast this documentary series as the best tv series of just does not sum up the sheer brilliance that this series provides in quality entertainmentoverall this is the best tv series of with no competition and maybe the best tv series of s,positive

by hong kong had given the world such films as sammo hungs encounters of the spooky kind chow yun fat in john woos iconic a better tomorrow zu warriors and the classic mr vampire jackie chan was having international success on video but it was with a chinese ghost story that hk cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the west for many yearswestern filmgoers had never seen anything like it it was a film that took various ingredients that hk cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and bestdirector siu tung ching still best known as an action choreographer on such films as woos a better tomorrow the killer has under the watchful eye of legendary producer tsui hark created a masterpiece of fantasy horror cinema and with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than martial arts coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkablethe editing by the amazingly prolific david wu who wrote directed the bride with white hair and edited such classic titles as a better tomorrow hardboiled and the cult hit the club is quite simply a work of genius his crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best hk cinema has ever created fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their artthe crew of cinematographers have also done miracles this is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an ever present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold its a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty even the silken robes and dresses worn by hsiao tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen even a simple scene where hsiao tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act the sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale the production design by zhongwen xi deserves the highest praiseanother major factor to the films success is the music by romeo diaz and james wong hong kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on a chinese ghost story the music is quite simply vital from the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the charactersthe score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but its in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into its own here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an hk film add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over tsau shens and hsiao tsings love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful this is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a films music can haveand we of course have the acting talent leslie cheung a better tomorrow and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector his work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with joey wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocencejoey wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the chow yun fat andy lau classic god of gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here she is the epitome of ethereal beauty her portrayal of the tragic hsiao tsing is stunning she shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths veteran actor wu ma mr vampire swordsman is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy yen he treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease and what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorablebut what about the monsters and beasties i hear you cry well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting tsau shen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective lord black complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work most of which has to this day never been toppedbut the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirits killer tongue we first encounter this thing with an evil dead style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal french kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks but later its shown in all its crazy glory it can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils its slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks it can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth its an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldnt work but it does to fantastic and unforgettable effectso what all this adds up to is a classic example of hong kong movie making a true team effort that has

this is my first comment on imdb website and the reason im writing it is that were talking about one of the best films ever ne goryuy will make you laugh and cry at the same time you will fall in love if youre not a fan yet with georgian choir singing tradition and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it what i like a lot about this film is that actors in the non leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character the film is starring vahtang kikabidze who is great but you will remember every single face around him in the film you will find yourself quoting their lines that have become household names for so many russian speaking people a film to live with simple yet deep you will want to watch it again and again,positive
it was a fun film to look at though the chance this happened in your street is small there are still a lot off recognizable situations that will ring a bell the simplicity of the film and the humour do work i must admit that you dont have to see it in a theater it will do very well on a small tv set tip see it with some close friends,positive
lauberge espagnole is full of energy and its honest realistic and refreshing not a comedy or drama but more a slice of life movie about this particular group of very interesting but still normal young people who share an apartment in barcelona for one year beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack if youre older this movie should bring back a flood of good memories if youre young learn by this example,positive
spoilers a jewish frodo yep thatll be elijah wood againever since the concluding part of lord of the rings elijah wood as frodo has found it increasingly difficult to get away from that major role playing a football hooligan a psychopath and now a young jewish american wood has tried any route he can to escape this typecasting now with everything is illuminated he might finally have achieved this playing a role which isnt as radical as other efforts he truly gets to the soul of his character still it isnt like wood does this alone aided by a magnificent adaptation by first time directer liev schreiber and a wonderful performance by newcomer eugene hutz wood has found a magnificent production to spread his wings everything is illuminated is a magnificent moving piece of cinemajonathan safran foer wood a young american jew sets out to the ukraine to find the mysterious girl who rescued his grandfather and helped him get to america arriving in the country jonathan meets the all talking all dancing alex hutz and his racist grandfather boris leskin travelling across the country the three slowly learn more and more about the history and relations that alex and jonathan never knew existedits a strange feeling when the film progresses into its second chapter it is actually divided into four overall the first part whilst occasionally a bit funny is mostly serious and intense so when we are given a brief history of alex and his family in the second part to switch from serious to hilarious is a weird step it doesnt quite work but as the film progresses it definitely learns its lesson as this mix of humour and sadness merges finer as time passesto the ultimate credit of everyone involved as the story does continue so do we begin to fall for the characters more and more elijah wood is magnificent boris leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why hollywood has never properly noticed him most notable of all however is newcomer eugene hutz playing an intensely troubled character hutz is absolutely brilliant he shows the split between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when his character is communicating with wood you genuinely connect with him on a deeper level without hutz the story is so strong that the film would still be magnificent but with him it hits the next levelas a debut work for actor turned director liev schreiber the story is also a brilliant piece to start a work of passion schreibers grandfather himself an immigrant to america he manages to truly embrace the emotion of the content and by presenting us with some truly beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots he manages to really hit home the final half hour in particular is so beautifully created that its a challenge for a tear not to form in any viewers eye it is a moving story and with schreibers help it becomes even more powerfulconstructed with love from a passionate director everything is illuminated is a beautiful piece a road story with a difference it is magnificently acted and wonderfully written its a film that everyone should see and it is the perfect way for elijah wood to finally lay frodo to rest,positive
hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to aronofskys movie of it that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky didthe film seems laughably anti gay at times especially when in the film homosexuality equals death one gay character gets stoned is launched skyward by a speeding car and lands dead on the pavement another is crucified and still more are simply beat up another exaggerated piece of shock value that might actually have been compelling if it were done well are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike breakers whod have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosionsthe director uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director but he is far below the cut for real movies the film is clunky that cant even seem to settle on a genre lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not im not joking her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits a failure,negative
i didnt really like this movie that much at all it wasnt really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid rob schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in i mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but thats about it the only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and im not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found all in all it was a couple notches below an average moviefinal querytheaters so glad i didnt squander too much money on thisdvd purchase ummm let me thinknorental if you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not,negative
i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version everything from the acting the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera to the camera shots all medium or close up shotsno scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots were absolutely terrible i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of minutes of my vacation not recommended by any stretch of the imagination,negative
this is classic s humor if you were a teen in the s this was a summer hit to go see it was a early look at those now super stars this and better off dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager even crazy family and friends like these characters to be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun the uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner the twin brothers who look nothing alike and to meet hoopz was so much fun this may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon,positive
yep this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies but i have definately seen worse think gremlins rated r well anyway i met rick sloane at some sci fi convention that amazingly he was lecturing at it was one of those really low budget conventions where everything goes an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap you should have of seen what some friends and i brought inhe seemed like a very nice guy he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins and he even told me not to take it seriously and said he loved the mstk versionall in all rick sloane knew what he was doing and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks so i guess im standing up for this movie and giving it a and betraying all my fellow msties sorry guys,negative
this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral in fact if theyd called it sex at a funeral they might have done better at the box officebut the film falls between two stools and cant get up the characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human one arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterpriseandie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton as of all things a police detective dont they have a height requirement over there ms staunton seems unable to make a false move would that we could say the same about the writer directorif notting hill annoyed you as being bogus stay away from this one phonus bolognus on the half shell,negative
the movie begins with much voice over a bad sign then it just slides downhill with silly and intelligence insulting scenes involving trappers and indians but it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry mountain men square dance with each other in a high alpine meadow meanwhile the happy go lucky indians sit around watching them its a better scene than the dancing cowboys in blazing saddles there is a minor flaw in this comparison across the wide missouri is not a comedy,negative
the film opens with bill coles melvyn douglas telling a story about how his best friend make that client jim blandings cary grant and his family are tightly packed into a small new york apartment with not enough closet space and way too few bathrooms when jims wife muriel myrna loy wants to renovate the apartment advertising exec jim falls in love with or falls for an ad for a house once hes purchased the house bills and frustration pile up incessantly as everything that can go wrong with the building of jims dream house goes wrongone of three collaborations between grant and loy this is a charming little comedy not very taxing with no real great message but a great way to spend an hour or two the laughs are there right from the start when the alarm clock goes off and jim tries to shut it off only to be thwarted at every turn by muriel the timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a couple of seasoned pros and thats just what grant and loy give us polished performances simple chemistry and a lot of fun myrna loy is in a pretty thankless role its evident that grants character jim gets the lion share of the lines and the acting and grant as always pulls both off with remarkable aplomb but she gives muriel a colour life and bite that only myrna loy can give a character melvyn douglas plays wry amusement to perfection as well never hitting a single wrong noteone of my favourite scenes has definitely got to be when bill gets himself locked in the store room and jim goes to save him only to get everyone trapped inside every little problem that pops up for the blandings renovation project including petty jealousy and an ad campaign for wham seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new house but makes it believable and an enjoyable watch,positive

while the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film and what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence it features the combination of the highest form of truly american music gershwin the engaging beauty of french impressionistic art kellys enthralling choreography including his rapturous pas de deux damour really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist,positive
i have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest worst attempts at one a lot of the scenes work in a plug and play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic comedy genre usually this is okay because were dealing with a genre but the challenge generally resides in making it original new and inventive this movie fails to do sothere is no sense of who the characters really are apart from sylvie moreaus who is the real star of this movie not isabelle blais they fit into this one dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrativethe pacing of the movie can become annoying rhythm lacks and the editing is filled with unnecessary close ups i should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally or rather making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious of course along with that you have the right on cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatchedi cant believe that a movie who makes obvious woody allen allusions ends up being this deceptive if you expect a good light hearted romantic comedy this is not it or rather this a poor attempt at it you will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than years old and there are far superior quebecois directors making better flicksles aimants is a good movie for what it is but its a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteurs,negative
a sweet and totally charming film shall we dansu made me laugh and cry at first appearance sugiyama san was not terribly appealing an uptight salaryman seemingly devoted to his family but all too easily captivated by a face in a window the object of his obsession is distant and cold but by the end of the movie i was in love with him her his wife and daughter all the dance instructors and dance students this uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a little jewel that i would enjoy seeing again,positive
there may be spoilerscharlie fineman adam sandler who lost his family in a tragedy the terrorist attacks of sept still grieves over their deaths he runs into his former college roommate alan johnson don cheadle and the two rekindle their friendship alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss this is a simplification of the basic story of reign over me this movie is however a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling he feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality he is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work he cant express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world he chances upon charlie on the streets of manhattan while driving from his job eventually he meets and discovers that charlie who originally does not remember alan is living in a false reality of his own charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family he lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band collecting vinyl records of the s and s bands and playing video games he has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better place his landlady is his protector and great enabler his in laws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life and alan is most affected by him because alan wants to in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality to be with charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help charlie begin to recover from his self induced guilt and denial of loss it is through this relationship that not only is charlie able to begin to heal himself but that alan in fact learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and eventually is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her it is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and alan are talking about the situation together over chinese that charlie states that he is in fact worried about alan and not himself this movie will if you let it take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking it will have you laughing at how charlie uses his words like people really do in everyday life to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation it will leave you on the verge of tears in my case actual tears when charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss and that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew denial it will make you curse at the cold unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his case as i actually did at charlies hearing and it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise stern judge donald sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise stern person in the legal profession since wilford brimley played an assistant attorney general in absence of malicethis movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons i never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film which means it had me from the beginning to the end although the cast was interracial this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film race was a non factor to the performance of the roles in this movie amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out and the only real reference to is when charlies financial attorney refers to the tragedy of charlies loss as what charlie had become on time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then reign over me succeeded phenomenally as far as i am concerned i have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and i will wait impatiently for the day i can purchase it as a dvd,positive
im not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls shock movies do not an oscar make,negative

this movie doesnt even have the saving grace of being so bad that its good it is truly appalling its closer to a tongue in cheek parody than a disaster movie but alas they were serious made for tv but not worthy of even that it contains every cliché and cheesy plot moment you can imagine oh will he save the town from the flood will his wife admit that she still loves him will they escape before the flood drowns them i cant explain how bad this is awful predictable plot that makes you wince it is so cheesy bad effects although to be fair i have seen worse super imposed bubbling water bad script woeful acting hideous so bad in fact that you probably should get drunk and watch it,negative

many americans are lazy and this has manifested itself even in our dvd watching many of us dont like to take the time to read an hour and a half or more of subtitles so we choose not to see many foreign films one film that is totally worth your time no matter how mundane a task you might think the subtitle reading is however is the green butchers its by far the best foreign film ive ever seen and tops many american films ive seen lately as well its a complex situation told in a remarkably simple and funny dialogue the character depth derived in this film is amazing the way svend and eigel sorry if those are spelled wrong feed off each others contrasting personas is downright spectacular the actors were well cast and im very much hoping that a sequel is in considerationit needs very little of bjorne and whats her facejust give me svend and eigel on some sort of journey with supporting characters and more amazing dialogue to the author of this fine screenplay i say write more the story itself is rather twisted but youll find yourself rooting for the bad guy anyhowwith no remorse please check this movie out,positive
pretty poor firestarter clone that seems more like a bad tv movie than a bad feature film how disappointing for this to come from hooper and dourifgovernment contractors do a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb the boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of degrees and when hes an adult people in his life start spontaneously combusting he tries to find out whythe people completely on fire are well done but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense theyre obviously changed to dummies when jets of fire shoot out of characters arms it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receivers earpiece how is that supposed to happen exactlysomething else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents we later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies,negative
i only came here to check terror hospital for an alternate title so id know what not to pick up not only do i get the original title but i come to find terror hospital is one of seven more aliasesthis one is a real clunker movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment mostly amusement this has none of that instead the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way too convenient for the situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room and all this is half of the film forget trying to figure out where anybody is or who they are during darkened or nighttime scenes too you probably wont care anyway there is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old drivers ed movies i slep er i mean sat through and watched way back in high school really were talking about mysticism possession and a killer on the loose here not a bad recipe for trash cinema unfortunately theres nothing here to make it even good trash when joined to the aforementioned the bad acting and not so special effects are just that bad acting and not so special effects this ones just trash pure and simple leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale theres a reason its there,negative
this movie seems to have a lot of people saying it is one of the most brutal of all time after having just viewed it i can say it does not live up to those claimsthe idea of the movie is indeed demented but overall the execution wasnt at all cringe worthy even the final scene the eyeball thing isnt really that nasty i was expecting something insane instead it was of lower quality than gore put forth on films like the ultra low budget violent shtany one wanting to see an actual movie will be disappointed since there is no story whatsoever though surely most people know this gore fans will be disappointed since contrary to belief the blood and guts here are few and far between not to mention the actress playing the victim might be one of the worst in historyregardless of what people say this movie isnt that shocking it just plain all out sucks avoid it,negative

im not sure how this could have been better so i gave it a the acting was excellent the main woman was so hot the chap who played darwyn was a smouldering pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering the truck drivers death is one exampleexcellently the storyline was believable and the series length was just about right ie i love lost but will it ever end as a brit i tend to think of yanks as gung ho the lapd were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him but the other agencies were portrayed positively my main thought about programmes like this and the also excellent is could it happen would it happen is it happening now possibly probablyi hope they do another series but after reading some of the previous comments it would appear notto summarise if you havent seen it make sure you do,positive
pola x is a beautiful adaption of herman melvilles pierre or the ambiguities the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion the story is of pierres downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and idiolect the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epici cant stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling i know im gushing here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film its the best ive seen all year,positive
i enjoyed it in general im not a fan of comedies and comedians but i do like whoopi im also partial to sci fi fantasy and the dinosaur craze i read for pleasure but when im feeling over stressed or really mind dead i watch tv movies to escape theodore rex enabled me to do so that makes it a success in my eyes i didnt even walk away to do something else while it was running whether or not it was rated as good or not doesnt really matter to me and no im not a juvenile nor am i a moron,positive
i grew up on this movie and i can remember when my brother and i used to play in the backyard and pretend we were in care a lot now after so many years have passed i get to watch the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it if you are parent and you have not watched this movie with your children then you should just so you hold them in your arms and watch them get thrilled over the care bears and care a lot the songs especially forever young are very sweet and memorable parents i highly recommend this movie for all kids so they can learn how enjoyable caring for others can be when it comes down to all the trash that is on tv you can raise your children to have the right frame of mind about life with movies like these,positive
hg wells is spinning no doubt about itreally this would have been a decent sci fi adventure movie if it hadnt been based on a classic novel and directed by the authors grandson i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and simpleminded bastardizationthe novel is a great sci fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when theyre very young is that its overflowing with social commentary the eloi and morlocks are a satire of the class distinctions of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything decays and degenerates a satiric jab at victorian complacency and their belief that their civilization would last forever theres no love story no romance with a beautiful eloi womanin the novel the eloi are foot tall childlike beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time traveler does befriend an eloi woman but its clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway shes killed before the novel endsthis movie first tries to give us a totally stupid backstory as to why he wants to travel through time the treacly romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomitthe journey into the future is punctuated by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally degenerates as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take placethe general story ugh a total misrepresentation of the novel the eloi are too competent and warlike the morlocks are too intelligent the ubermorlock is an embarrassment and theres no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawnsamantha mumba does ok guy pearce is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a rib while filming this he also looks unhealthy and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making thisa sad sorry film version of one of the worlds classics h g wells deserves bettermuch better,negative
it has been widely agreed that hayao miyazaki is a master at his craft when it comes to combining rich animation with thoughtful story lines and similarly imaginative characters his movies from nausicaa totoro kiki laputa and mononoke to the recent howls moving castle are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art but in terms of movie making as well can this man do no wrong not really but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels his newest film ponyo an unashamedly family friendly tale of a goldfish out of water is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect and yet this is the first film of his which treads into lesser territory dont get me wrong ponyo is not a bad movie by any means as mentioned it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as totoro and kiki the problem is that the story doesnt stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing in depth plotfor its opening hour ponyo is miyazaki storytelling at its finest in which a rowdy and overeager young goldfish who later becomes named ponyo makes a forbidden trip to the human world where she is subsequently adopted by a boy her own age named sosuke modeled interestingly after the directors own son this does not please ponyos father a mysterious wizard named fujimoto who is very angry at the humans for their destruction of the sea this environmentalist theme is not much different from miyazakis other films a problem he very much intends to rectify by creating jellyfish from the prow of his submarine he separates the pair and tries to talk ponyo into staying underwater with him the goldfish however has already tasted both sosukes blood healing a cut on his finger and some of the human food ham which she becomes inexplicably addicted to and of course steals into her fathers forbidden potions transforming into a hyperactive young girl who is the spitting image of mei from my neighbor totoro this triggers a dangerous tsunami which threatens to engulf the entire world with water conspiring with his wife gran mamare a diaphanous sea goddess who alternatingly shifts from super sized titan to human size form fujimoto decides to test the two youngsters love for each other they do this by elevating the sea to the level of sosukes house prompting the youngsters to set out across their now ocean infested world in an over sized toy boat made possible by ponyos own magical powersit is at this point where ponyo begins to run out of steam although ponyo and sosuke are adorable and the scenes involving them are funny and cute they slow down the film where the film really takes on water unfortunately is at the climax in which sosuke must prove his love to ponyo presented in a way which is strangely anticlimactic and rushed bringing an otherwise charming tale to an abrupt halt this will likely underwhelm viewers expecting another instant masterpiece from the man who has delivered far more interesting finales for many of his other movies remember the destruction of laputa satsukis search for little mei kikis rescue of tombo porco rossos fight with curtis the rescue of the forest spirits head or even the test between chihiro and yubaba all those resolutions were far more satisfying and felt more complete than this oneon a technical level ponyo cannot be faulted the animation is absolutely gorgeous to look at produced entirely without a single shot of computer generated imagery and naturally joe hisaishi provides us with yet another breathtaking musical score the best moments being the rousing sequences underwater accompanied by a chorus and a soprano voice and the backgrounds are lovingly painted and detailed as any other ghibli movieshaving proved themselves worthy on translating and dubbing ghiblis previous movies into english with top quality results disney studios and pixar once again provide an english dub complete with a mostly capable cast of actors frankie jonas is surprisingly good as sosuke sounding very natural and believable throughout noah cyrus as ponyo on the other hand sometimes goes overboard in shouting her lines before eventually settling down toward the end leads aside the rest of the cast includes liam neeson as the overprotective fujimoto who manages himself unsurprisingly well in the character cate blanchett as gran mamare in an omnipresent tone which is not much different from her galadriel in lord of the rings matt damon as sosukes constantly seafaring father koichi who is good but nothing to write home about and tina fey as lisa of them fey is the best voice in the entire cast imbuing the character with just the right amount of spirit and personality her scenes with sosuke show real chemistry on the other hand cloris leachman who was spectacular as dola in castle in the sky is disappointingly wasted as one of three handicapped elderly women she barely has any lines who are also voiced by betty white and lily tomlin of them only tomlins character a cantankerous woman named toki shows any real personality but if i were casting the movie id switch tomlin with leachman probably the only really jarring drawback of the dub is a blasty techno remix of the films catchy but ridiculously repetitive title song which thankfully doesnt occur until midway through the closing creditson the whole ponyo is a good film a fine piece of animated work which is perfect for youngsters and family audiences due to the loss of momentum toward the end though it falls far short of classic status since miyazaki at his least is still better than a majority of other animated films though ill be generous and give ponyo a full star recommendation because any feature of his is still very much worth watching particularly on the big screen be sure to catch it in the theaters while you can,positive
i can not believe the positive reaction to this movie i had great expectations for it and was disappointed first of all they used every cheesy racism cliché in the book it was so predictable for instance from the second the young latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger matt dillons character has been played a million times a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie the predictability hardly ended with those characters a phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script the morals of the story were pc to the max there were a few clever twists but not nearly enough the dialouge was embarrassing at times it wasnt all badi just cant believe this movies high score so far it was somewhat entertaining just a little insulting to ones intelligence i admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short,negative
this film stars among others slapchop vince offer who also wrote edited and directed and joey buttafuoco not exactly names that scream out quality and with such uplifting skits as supermodels taking a dump its exactly what it sounds like a guy who robs a sperm bank the rhymer necrophilia with a rotting corpse black market fetuses featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar lots and lots of gay jokes a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions the skits are painfully unfunny such as batman and rhymer the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crudeand stupid i truly believe a group of year olds could have easily made a funnier film with the same budgetapparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by slap shot vince against the scientologists frankly i wouldnt know who to root for in this case apparently he alleged that somehow scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film no matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and unfunny by comparison ebola is funnierand these are the nicest things i can say about the movieby the way that is bobby lee from mad tv wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film its amazing his career could overcome this,negative
does anything at all happen in this movie there are only the bizarre short scenes where i didnt know what the hell was going on so that doesnt count this movie is sooo boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies confused well i was after watching this crap what was donald sutherland on because he missed it with this one completely and whats with the pedofile scene at the beginning of the movie can put anyone to sleep,negative
normally when i write a review for a movie online it is for one of three reasons either i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent i feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as this is one of the best films of all time does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good which should be the point of the review in the first place with that being said war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried incompetent attempt at a money grab piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger now with most of the insults out of the way allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sams club for bucks i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular check this is not a big deal for me as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score check again what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien battle scenes now as per imdbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance no matter how small so here is fair warning the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot seriously it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth but by the end of the first ten minutes the combination of shaky camera work spliced scenes and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer however the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going the next minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot they both walk back to town these walks arent two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie in a particularly grueling scene the main character is shown looking at a pod then he is shown pacing and panting then he looks at the pod then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town then comes in to town and walks into a building then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod i apologize for the extreme run on sentence but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film characters speak way too long about mundane things they walk a lot they send other people to walk the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed but for no dramatic effect simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere the editing is mind bogglingly bad people actions make little sense for instance when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town the farmer stutters and paces around when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion i have seen better high school video productions finally the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage however it is so awful in technical aspects and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad avoid this film at all costs,negative
a moderately interesting start some pretty scenes in sixteenth century japan and a promising idea but the execution the comparison that springs to mind after about fifteen minutes is cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death really a specialist in oriental history who doesnt speak any japanese walks on tatami without removing her shoes and is generally dumb as celery please this looks like a student film the sets are risible the acting except perhaps for the title character close to wooden the plot utterly arbitrary at least cannibal women was funny this is best watched with someone who knows something about japan just to watch disbelief repeatedly crawl across their face,negative
i watched this movie and the original carlitos way back to back the difference between the two is disgusting now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script now maybe its just me but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didnt know rise to power is just a movie that has carlitos name there should have been at least a few characters from the original movie the ending makes no sense in relation to the original in the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie and his woman isnt even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original i would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to its big brother dont lay awake at night waiting to see this watch the original one more time if you really need a hit,negative
i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving was not as episodic and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movieit also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole i have heard many strange reasons such as a because yoda died b because bobba fett died c because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was a momentous period in the movie i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous i can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against a legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starthe last reason that i care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what i would have done in that scene too if i were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmeton another note i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves i never go into a film with that deception in mind i always try to go into a film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but i can not know for sure lets see that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasi am not sure who criticizes these movies but i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite that it is rotj i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its minutes there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any dayfinally i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately,positive
i was very displeased with this move everything was terrible from the start the comedy was unhumorous the action overdone the songs unmelodious even the storyline was weightless from a writer who has written successful scripts like guru and dhoom i had high expectations the actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all of course kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds i think hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done they tend to exaggerate way too much in chinese films this style works because that is their signature piece but hindi cinemas signature are the songs a good action movie should last no more than two hours and cannot look unrealistic but in the future im sure these action movies will get much sharper also to be noted comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly good luck next time,negative
im really not going to waste my time with in depth analysis im just going to say that im extremely disappointed that catherine zeta jones made the mistake of being in the main role in this absurd nonsense in this full of clichés boring to death thoughtless pathetic try in film making there is no point in trying to find the positive sides of this movie because as a whole it is poor in every single way and the saddest thing is that zeta jones is dragged so uncompromisingly into the clichés that she has absolutely no chance of showing even of her talentavoid this movie even at the opportunity of spending the night at home starring at the wall,negative
in what i can say was a theft of my time i was taken to see this movie and i must say what a horrible experience fay ann lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie larryjoe is obviously a shill reviewer the plot is thin to say the least the cantonese dialog is not funny see this movie at your perildavid tang from shanghai tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate the banal plot attempts to compete with other rom coms out there and just blends into the scenery it was like watching paint dry in short this movie was a total waste of time and space ive seen better movies on youtube,negative
i hadnt heard of soap girl but i saw a poster with a five star review from film threat outside the theater so i figured how bad could it be well i soon found out my god this film was awful the most wooden acting i have ever seen outside of a porn flick absolutely agonizing dialogue i just cant understand how this was made and why anyone agreed to be a part of it and i find it completely unfathomable that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it how did this happen and most importantly what the was the guy from film threat thinking,negative
this is the ultimate kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie this is the only kung fu movie i have ever seen i am giving this movie way too much credit my best guess for the reason for making this movie is that someone wanted to show off someone elses martial arts abilities but realized that you cant just film a guy fighting another guy and have people watch it so he put a story behind the fighting and people still didnt watch itthis movies story line was onion skin thin that acting was goofy and stereotypical of any kung fu movie the dubbing was literally the worst i have ever heard it seemed if you played a small role in this movie like the fat guy or the two guys trying to catch the main character with a net it didnt matter who over did your voice it could have been a dyslexic with a slurred stutter and nobody would have said anything but beside all of this the movie makes up for itself with the somewhat awesome fight scenesthe fight scenes were definitely what this movie was all about but the instigations of the fights were totally absurd on most all instances a guy either pops out of the tall grass or glances at the main character from a distance and then attacks him but once the fighting started things sort of balanced out there were only two things that really hampered the fighting though those constant wooshing sound effects that were added to every swing of a fist or foot or sword and the poor editing that made percent of the fighting very jumpy and choppy someone would be in the middle of a back flip and then suddenly be on the ground being kicked and then instantly be back on their feet blocking a punch but while the cut and paste editing was more of a nuisance than anything else it didnt really affect the overall moviein the end this was not a great movie but i wasnt expecting a great movie a great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box cover like this movies all i saw this movie as was a way to pass an hour and a half of boredom i rarely say that but this was just one of those movies you have no practical use for so you watch it whenever you have some free time enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it good day gentlemen scott,negative
first off im a huge bronson fan have been since the late s i watched every film he made on the big screen since love and bullets which ironically was the beginning of his end as a big name hollywood blockbuster stari kept hoping that things would turn around for him that he would make a really good film in the s but that never happened and i dont know what he was thinking when he signed with cheapjack studio cannon and hack director j lee thompson for most of his latter filmsassasination gave me some hopes when i saw that peter hunt was directing instead of thompson but those hopes were quickly dashed first off the film looks incredibly cheap like it was made for about mil minus bronsons inflated salary i heard he insisted on mil per picture which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his cannon films the white house scenes were filmed on the va grounds in west la i was taking the bus when they were shooting nice job on recreating the white house but did no one think about getting the palm trees out of the shots guess notsecondly the supporting cast is really bad ireland was dying of cancer and despite this shes not bad but the horrible asian woman playing bronsons sidekick was typical of cannons talent at the time non existent i would be real curious to learn how she got this role i cant imagine a worse actress for the part plus shes a good years younger than bronson the story is not that bad and its something that bigger and better budgeted studios did later eastwoods in the line of fire and costners bodyguard film but the way its staged here is really sad im wondering if they could not afford to do more than one or two takes per shot none of it is believable in the slightest if secret service men really behaved like the keystone cops in this movie wed have presidents rotating out of office and out of life every few months,negative
i mistakenly thought that this neo noir effort from the buffalo niagara falls area might be something different unfortunately i was incorrect there are are many problems with the falls that really have nothing to do with its low budget video production immediately one has to question why all the constant narration my feeling is that if you have a decent script the audience will follow along without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling the acting is very amateurish which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems finally the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video which i found to be totally unacceptable the narration bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided merk,negative
the sensuous nurse was a italian sexual comedy that starred the one time bond girl ursula andress man was she hot in this movie she was stacked and built like a brick house ursula was smoking hot in this movie i have never seen a nurses outfit that filled out before ms andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots one night the nurse decides to take the grandsons temperature and give some needed tlc to her ancient client the old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family what kind of job did the family hire her out to do will the geezer fall for her car giver how can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family to find out you need to find a copy of the sensuous nurse italian but badly dubbed into englishhighly recommended,positive
most critics seem to have dismissed this film like so many other charles bronson vehicles as just another patchwork of mindless violence and while there is a fair amount of mayhem death wish is not that awful of an effort particularly for fans of the series and its starthis time out aging charlies paul kersey is let loose by a police chief desperate to clean up a rough part of new york city the trigger happy vigilante moves into the heart of gang territory where he once again becomes a one man army in an urban war of good versus evil bronson at least the older version is truly at his bestim not saying death wish is a classic indeed to the discriminating eye it has a plethora of imperfections the characters are generally made of cardboard the violence is over the top a man well into his s outruns and outspooks dozens of young punks but in the tradition of the original death wish and later films such as falling down with michael douglas it has a definite crowd pleasing charm who doesnt want to see gangbangers get their due there are also some great cheesy moments and one liners so common in s films when a tenant of his apartment building sees kersey setting up a booby trap for instance the vigilante lightheartedly says hes thinning the herd a line only bronson can truly make workso you see the key to enjoying death wish is to accept it for what it is it aint spielberg and it aint art so throw the popcorn in the microwave and have fun with it,positive
i thought it was an extremely clever film i was very pleased with it and truly couldnt ask for more i actually own the film because i didnt return it to someone which i should do but i really want to keep it due to how much i enjoyed it also the fact i dont own too many foreign films and this is a first now i personally love finnish stuff so that definitely added to how much i enjoyed it but overall its worth watching however if youre not into the whole trying to understand finnish or read subtitles bit then this film is not for you for sure,positive
in one of the best of charlie chaplins lengthier short films he places the little fellow in the trenches of wwi where he brings his intolerable politeness and endless patience to the drudgery of trench life where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to overtake the enemy and usually to their deaths it takes someone of chaplins skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as trench warfare into such a brilliant comedy but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusinglike all of the best of chaplins films short films and otherwise this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of chalk on a board in the trench erasing one when he gets his helmet shot off the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette and of course the overtaking of the enemy all of these scenes are show stoppers reminiscent of the most wonderful chaplin scenes this one should not be missed,positive
due to rather dubious plate tectonics japan starts to slip under the sea initial predictions say itll take about years before the country is submerged but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than year the government think hes a crackpot but evidence soon starts bearing his theory outthis big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of hollywood films of the late s i assume having seen none of them with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human well japanese spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that ie its as naive in its psychology as its geology we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be uselessthe film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent hollywood production would be it is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in self awareness as that hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting it does have the hot evil chick from battle royale as one of the leads but shes not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hotthe film is much too long at minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking i certainly didnt care in the slightest whether japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end i was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should i ever find myself in that situation for realbut it does have nice special effects and kou shibasaki is still pretty hot so i magnanimously give it,negative

a lot people get hung up on this films tag as a childrens film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults takashi miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the childrens fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai warthe setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined what follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore but wait theres also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world however the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demon spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate resentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coalsthose whove played the video game sonic the hedghog might remember a certain dr robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddlys who sonic had to then liberatethe hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beansof course in this magical world of miikes yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in themin several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of childrens fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party the yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival and even then only to dance and party also the film ends not with the usual celebratory alls well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die this ending with its yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemons pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of over consumption the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around themin japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformedthis is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to and i believe it shows as theres a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness though ive focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off i do want to say that visually its a kaleidescope of cgi stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well theres a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either the yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who i believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a childrens film however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more oftenall and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performancesthe yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasnt come close to his apex instant classic,positive
just finished watching the groove tube which i first saw about years ago when i was a teenager staying up way past my bedtime watching hbo with my brother and his best friend we had also watched animal house just before that so we saw two movies that starred an snl alumna and had some naked breasts good thing our parents were asleep the whole time anyway there were lots of weird and funny things in this movie that were eye openers like the brown sequence of the uranus industries commercial with the taste of beef stew says the announcer as what is apparently human excrement comes out of a white tube ewww or the face of the puppet talking about vd a scrotum with a small penis with eyes glued on chevy chase and richard belzer made their feature film debuts here chase is hilarious whether doing a geritan spot with a woman stripping having his hands have sex in a let fingers do it commercial or singing four leaf clover with co writer director ken shapiro drumming his hands on his head belzer teams with shapiro in the dealers movie and on channel one evening news with one wild bit having belzer as a black prostitute trying tricks on reporter ken who plays lionel here lionel that sounds like a train that im going to ride like a choo choo other outrageous bits include the koko show with shipiro as a kid clown show host who after ordering the people over ten to leave the room reads requests of his viewers like passages of fanny hill or how about the olympics segment with a german couple making love being announced by two men one of them spanish as they get explicit while please stand by keeps interrupting on the screen or the animated segment on the dealers which depicts dancing toilets after shapiro ingested some marijuana not everythings so dirty besides the four leaf clover skit at the end theres a highly amusing music segment with ken lip syncing his own recording of just you just me while dancing with suit and briefcase around the city with occasionally a cop co writer lane sarasohn joining in so in summation this is one weirdly funny movie that seemed to influence other like films tunnelvision kentucky fried movie and possibly saturday night live which made chevy that shows first star and despite some dated elements can still amuse today ps while i liked hearing curtis mayfields move on up during the gorillas dancing hitchhiking beginning sequence i did wonder what the point was with the sequence of the hitchhiker and the woman who picked him up having them running from the car stripping on the run and then having the naked man get caught by the cop who stopped on the road guess its one of those s streaking things,positive
my only problem with the curse of the were rabbit is that the movie does not take the time to properly introduce wallace and gromit to those not familiar with parks short films strangely a close shave manages to do this with a lot less time to spare still i loved seeing the boys back in action and loved all the new characters human and otherwise i especially loved ralph fiennes voice as the scheming victor quartermaine it is also interesting to see the series on the large screen the workmanship with the clay characters really stands out its a hoot and great for the whole family i buy very few dvds but i have every wallace and gromit and will happily add this one,positive
never realized that charles boyer luis denard appeared with lauren bacallrose cullen in a film together and enjoyed their great acting together even peter lorre contreras had a role in this film and had a bad misfortune in his bathroom that caused him to faint this story deals with a republican courier luis denard who visits england during the spanish civil war and tries to disrupt a coal mining contract that will cause great harm to other nations lauren bacall rose cullen comes to the aid of luis denard by picking him up and at the same time falling in love with him and then proceeds to help him escape from an angry crowd of english mine workers who threaten his life the real bad guy in this film is victor francen licata beast with five fingers who gives an outstanding performance great classic film without humphrey bogart,positive
christopher smith is an obvious horror fan and this is made clear in his debut horror flick creep creep although a little bit loose on information proves itself worthy of a true gory classic a little less glossy than recent us horrors amityville horror remake house of wax remake this dark and gruesome tale follows kate franka potente through the labyrinth of underground tunnels and disused railways as she and a number of others along the way try and flee a murderous attacker though some bad reviews have slated this film i truly believe that on a tight budget and for a uk production from first time director smith that creep truly does live up to its name it delivers fast paced gory action more or less from the beginning sometimes too fast as the story is patchy in some areas but with a perfect location and the best character reaction at the end ive seen in a while creep delivers some scenes that are definitely the stuff of nightmares,positive
why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime conan is perhaps the only sword and sorcery movie better the brutal violence cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies around it is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that i have ever seen this is not similar to bakshis usual frenetic style its quite a departure for bakshi and in my opinion his best work i hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves,positive
gung ho is one of those movies that you will want to see over and over again michael keaton is put in charge of wooing a japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of hadleyville what happens after that is one hilarious moment after another the two cultures clash and it is up to keaton to hold things together look for great performances from keaton gedde watanabe george wendt mimi rogers john turturro soh yamamura and sab shimomo all are perfectly cast dont be fooled by the low number rating this is a in my book it is interesting to note that the town name of hadleyville was also used in high noon yes there is a real hadleyville but in oregon,positive
my summary refers to the fact that this film has votes just short of making it eligible to be on imdbs infamous bottom list the lowest rated films on the website with a paltry score of only this would place the film at approximately between and on the list talk about a very dubious achievement my score of isnt that bad but it does bring the film that much closer to the dreaded listas for the film it stars the once cute aaron carter yet another prepackaged and forgettable pop star of the s when he first broke onto the scene he was a cute kid with some songs that appealed to pre teens and tweeners on radio disney his songs look and image were all scrupulously groomed and created by marketing folks and did the trick leading to some huge album sales unfortunately by sales were in decline and carter had hit his awkward stage of life something all kids his age have to deal with eventually to put it bluntly he isnt cute any more in this film and is at a very tough stage of life i assume now hes a gorgeous young manbut in popstar hes no longer the heart throb he once was here he is just very normala death sentence for a kid in his position as a pop sensationinterestingly the film has some appearances by some other ex teen heart throbs from the last few decades including a roles for david cassidy and leif garrett two guys who also know what its like to disappear from the limelight cassidy managed to pick up the pieces and make a niche for himself while garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after stardom has been a bit of a joke hopefully carter will take after cassidy in the future and so far thankfully hes managed to avoid the negative publicity and court appearances of many ex pop idols i was far from thrilled with the film but seriously wish him best in this department its not his fault he was plastered across the radio and television throughout the early to mid sin this film carter doesnt exactly need to stretch himself he plays a pop star however despite making millions and being adored by girls he doesnt have it all hes quite dense mostly because he has little interest in learning the problem is so bad that his mother decides to no longer home school him forcing him to go to public school the problem though is that he is rather phobic about taking testsand making the grade in school is difficult so he gets the idea of finding a smart girl to date one who would naturally be obliged to help him out in school he picks the cute but bookish jane alana austin and pretends to really like her in a sad attempt to make this scheme workthis plot by the way isnt bad and could work even though it seems a lot like an episode of a show like the brady bunch or a nickelodeon sit com sure its predictable and you know that the formula will mean that she will eventually learn his plot and be hurt and he will eventually realize that he actually does care for her and by the end of the film all will be forgiven and theyll be a real couple but given good acting and competent direction this could be worth seeing for his teen fans as predictable isnt always bad and as it turned out this isnt exactly where the plot wentbut it was awfully closethere are a few good things i liked about the film seeing tom bosley and stella stevens playing janes grandparents was very nice their role was quite sweet and it was good seeing them again also s made for tv movie star andrew stevens appeared in the film it was nice to see him again though part of me hated him as he looks so great after all these years and i look ever bit of my years he did a fine job and it was nice seeing him in the same film as his mother stellaas for carter with his many prior experiences on tv he was not surprisingly pretty good while his relationship with jane didnt seem very believable he and ms austin gave it their best the film wasnt great but they did try and i think most of the problems with the film were in the writing with a better and less formulaic plot it could have worked much better plus the whole testophobia angle seemed pretty contrivedand rather insignificant who cares if a mega millionaire star gets anxious taking tests in school overall not a rotten film as the current rating would imply though there isnt much here to attract a wide audience people who grew up loving carter probably will enjoy the film older folks will probably care less as well as really young people who probably havent heard of him for them there is no nostalgia value in the filmmy favorite part of the filmleif garrett giving aaron advice i felt like screaming dont listen but didnt,negative
im not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this film because i just saw it and thought it was awesome i guess its not for everyone because its basically kafkas the trial meets beevis and butt head which is a pretty tough combination to swallow still i thought it was great if youre going to see it because you want a sequel to office space youre probably going to be disappointed but if you want to see one of the most brutal acid tongued and hilariously honest looks at where our society is headed youre in for a treat i just saw the pm show opening night in los angeles and there were only people in the theater which means the film will probably be gone in a week thats really a shame because in its own way idiocracy is one of the best satires to come along in quite a while but then again its basically making fun of the people who make up about of the movie going audience so i guess its no wonder the studio panicked and tried to dump it,positive
i barely remember this show a little but i remembered it was great my eldest brother reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the dvd set coming out the network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in its place it should have gone at least seasons why not right i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the gods of the entertainment world but they mis guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time let it be said that they have a lot more flops than hits this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up anyhow i am getting this for my collection,positive
this seventh yes you read right the seventh puppet master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be by a french puppeteer who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient mummies who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life it was taught to him by a sorcerer also on the run before he died he used this power to bring normal puppets to life this sequel is basically nonsense sprinkled upon even more nonsense like most of the puppet master sequels due to the pg rating we dont even get any entertaining puppet murders come to think of it there are no damn puppet murders if there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one no moregod please no more,negative

in paris avalon a computer generated system controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped detective karas craig must go against avalon to find herrenaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight manypixar are the animation masters their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch renaissance isnt a film aimed for the young audience though and like s persepolis brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generationin robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film makingvolckmans picture however is a full on animation but it doesnt half look realistic for the majority of its strong hour and minutes of running time the faces of the characters are well portrayed and in particular this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy and is finely directed alsofor anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapirenaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shotthe narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we dont see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cops attempts to rescue the mysterious woman and then we see craigs tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements there are many things wrong with the scripting not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages,positive
i must say that i am fairly disappointed by this horror movie i did not get scared even once while watching it it also is not very suspenseful either i was able to guess the ending half way through the movie so whats leftthe ring is a trully scary movie i wish other movies would stop copying from it eg the trade mark long hair please give me some originalitywill not recommend this movie,negative
i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasnt paying proper attention but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film from director lionel jefferies who played grandpa potts in chitty chitty bang bang basically it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in victorian london one night the father iain cuthbertson is visited by two strangers and he leaves with them and does not return they move to a cottage in the country and here the children bobbie jenny agutter who i first saw in childs play phyllis sally thomsett and peter gary warren keep their spirits up with their fascination for the nearby railroad everyday they wave faithfully to the passengers in the passing trains and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and are made heroes their kindness makes them friends including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father also starring dinah sheridan as mother mrs waterbury bernard cribbins as albert perks william mervyn as old gentleman peter bromilow as doctor forrest ann lancaster as ruth and gordon whiting as russian it was number on the greatest family films and it was number on the greatest british films very good,positive

sitting down to watch the th season of the bachelor on the wings of love i knew i would be in for an interesting time i had watched some of the previous seasons of the bachelor in passing watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so i find that the bachelor is often appealing and intriguing though its quality and morality are often lackingon the wings of love details the journey taken by jake a year old commercial pilot from dallas texas to find true love as true a love as one can find in a season long reality drama dating show jake meets beautiful girls from all over the country he begins to get to know them a bit but it is mostly superficial how well can you get to know someone in a few minute conversations jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning at least to the audience he noted that he doesnt just want love or a good time but he wants a fiancé or wife we can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well if that is the case it might explain to a degree some of the womens actions the women are super competitive while they dont even know jake at all yet they are still in it to win it no matter what the costnot only were the women competitive but they were also confident and catty threats backstabbing and warnings of watch out all show that these women werent there for a good time either jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal but looking for a connection however the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress jake with said sex appeal they arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses either low cut or shortwhile some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum others missed that memo altogether one girl channy noted that jake was a good guy to whom she could be a naughty girl she went on to say that jake could land on her runway anytime she got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situationsso a reality dating show couldnt be that bad could it besides the obvious issue of sex driven attraction there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show is this the right way to find a future mate vying for someones attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions unfortunately however that is what america has reduced dating to these days pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the sideanother problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to jake a few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached one girl said if i dont get that first impression rose it will kill me as mentioned before they dont even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose not just one of the roses to keep from being eliminatedmichelle in particular seemed to have some issues with attachment to jake the other girls noticed it too after one particular michelle outburst vienna asserted that michelle had a mental breakdown and weve only been here an hour michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show narrowly missing elimination and was extremely emotional about it the other girls thought it was simply ridiculous another girl also cried but because she was eliminatedit began with survivor and from there it just took off reality tv it shows our entertainment interests as a country if we werent watching the shows and giving them good ratings the networks would not continue to run them the only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of america is hooked one thing is clear america in general loves reality tv and its ensuing trappingsthis begs me to question why is it that we even like reality tv what is it about it that draws us to it is it because we see the similarities to our own lives or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others whatever it is that draws us to it we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds im not saying that all reality tv shows are bad however i am saying that we need to evaluate each oneepisodes used for critique season premier and episode,negative
i give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for damon wayans as the cosby show was for bill cosby it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and i felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character michael kyle an interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person he is phenomenal in movies but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though i loved it i felt that the laugh was more important than plausibilityjay kyle i have loved her since house party and have enjoyed her in school daze and martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to co star in i also feel that jay and michael were more like equals in the show but jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedjr just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts not to mention that most of the situations in episodes ive seen seems to center around himclair the attractive sister who dated a christian i found her boyfriends character to be more interesting than she was shed be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but its not stereotypical enoughkady lovable and the youngest daughter i think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and franklinfranklin i love this character and i think they derived it from smart guy tj mowry which only lasted one season they did a great job of casting for this little genius the effort would have been made if jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides alsoall in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and its homage to the cosby show is well done i love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that i cant wait to see the series finale,negative
probably the two main significances of elmers pet rabbit are that the wacky leporid featured in a wild hare now has a name and that he utters his famous of course you realize this means war for the first time mostly the termite terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long eared rascal its certainly a must see for hard core fans of this genre but others will probably have little reason to take interestbut make no mistake its quite hilarious what bugs bunny does to the eternally gullible elmer fudd clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon i recommend it,positive
what a piece of junk this movie was the premise was okay but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people even the effects in hercules was better i knew this would be bad but the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs its completely incoherent silly and stupid i felt like it had been written by some th grader in creative class and gotten a d i want to slap casper van diem and the other actors for following this movie throughive had my share of cheesy and bad movies i love the tremors series but this i do not recommend it at all its silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe,negative
this movie was one of the greatest movies ever made it had everything to make a movie great incredible acting awesome special effects oh wait i must be thinking of a good movie well this wasnt one of them it just plain sucked what i want to know is what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a when i casted my vote there were out there god knows what goes on in their head now as for any other vote a or was even too high but a come on what made this movie sooooo good to give it a i know these are the same that thought that jean claude van damme is a great dramatic actor,negative
this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time remember the all around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the watergate and a little later most movies trying to cash in on made for tv o so powerful o so mind numbing conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel gazing attitudei was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe i mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes lots of questions unanswered lots of dis communication well this takes at least bergman to build a movie about such un visual basesthe next man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesnt get any better in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up watcha that murders without ever advancing any storyline pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewers eyes,negative
the beginning of this film is a little clunky and also confusing but sit tight because you are in for the ride of your life the concept is compelling with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story there are fine performances all around with phillip seymour hoffmans being the best of the cast no surprise there ethan hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well the direction by mr lumet is outstanding the film has a seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs you will be greatly rewarded for the time invested in this film,positive
oh so beautiful oh so tearful and so gut wrenching makes everything seem so superficial so pale so meaningless in comparison sister helen is not a real saint she is a real human flawed raw and blunt but passionate and with a heart of goldwhat i found most interesting is that this handful of wretched miserable people found meaning and laughterwhat i loved most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature,positive
i adore this film as much as any one adores viewing whatever it was they saw when they were young it was one of those films that home box office showed every other day throughout my youth this film is forever lodged in my brain for someone who didnt grow up around this film you may have become spoiled by the add cycle weve been in since the mid s and may find it more difficult to appreciate this gem cool this is as my sis was doped up on better off dead before i saw this of which i raped loved and no one no one can deny the embrace of awkward teenage humor in american cinema in the s this gave birth to everything we have found tiresome in teen comediesbecause with all the overuse of slow mo the current soundtrack the new tech i wonder if cinema will go back to these roots this is the teen comedyyes,positive

i remember my dad hiring these episodes on video my whole family loved them and now that i have moved away from home and have my own life i am trying to share these fabulous jim henson creations with my husband and stepson but as i am starting to find out not everyone is a henson fan which is a pity since it means they will just have to put up with me searching for this series but even though they dont find these interesting i would highly recommend anybody getting hold of the storyteller you will be lost in a world of tales from a time when people could only talk about unexplained situations through stories and how people need to care if they were ever confronted with these situations,positive
mild spoilersthis movie was filthy and stupid it could have done well without the constant humping and nude sex it was also very profane i think that they had a good story developing but they messed up the whole thing by overdoing it,negative
personally this is one of my favorites of all time no im not im i own an old original vhs of this that i bought from a rental store ive watched it countless timeswhile its an amusing movie for kids its an intriguing movie for adults i once saw this movie whiile i was not sober my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before i saw morals being strongly encouraged both overtly and somewhat subliminally i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular but its been a very long time since then rest assured there are tons of things that are alluded to throughout the movie if you get the chance to view it not sober do so you wont be disappointed as a matter of fact you will probably feel rather happy and warmunique and wonderful,positive
ok im normally pretty open minded about movies i can normally see a good side to a film which has been totally pandered by others this is an exceptioni wont waste to much energy telling you what happens but think along the lines of bill and ted meets the worst police academy movie out of all of them and you wont be far offthe thing that really got me about this film was the stupid purile racism that was evident throughout the general theme of latino black guys cool white guys lame is slightly amusing for the first couple of jokes but when the same joke has been reiterated for the th time not an exageration by the way it gets both tiresome and offensivei spent months waiting for the laws of karma to get back at john leguizamo for this film i had almost given up hope when the my vh awards were screened live in the uk what followed was mr leguizamo performing the rare feat of a comedian bombing on stage youd have to be a complete sadist to laugh at him ahem ha ha ha,negative
what reviewers and mstk left out is the best part and only memorable scene of this otherwise dreadful movie there is a very good rape in the shower scene committed by the bad guy ben gazzara look alike on maria as mentioned killed later through tjs ineptitude perhaps rape is too strong a word prison mating ritual may be more appropriate the background behind this chance yet forced meeting is the mobster who is hiding ben gazzara introduces him to the girls hanging out at his pool the ish blonde disses him but our villain must be quite smitten by her because the courtship is on at that point his first move is to attempt drowning her until his mafia don benefactor tells him to knock it off kind of like the girl in high school you didnt like but still wanted to have carnal knowledge of anyway lets just say he catches up with her in the cabana later,negative
i had high hopes when i went into the theatre having seen the trailer i was as hyped as the next person to see great talent participate in the making of a story with a beautiful premisehowever its disappointing to see this talent laid waste by the poor composition of songs the words are chunky and cheesy probably because it was composed with a more western theme i wouldnt find it difficult to imagine the same melodies with french or english lyrics in mandarin they just sound strangethe musical items were also cut together badly far too quickly to be enjoyable and the shots of the actors looking anguished lasted far too longthe special effects are the next disappointment suffice it to say it is highly obvious where the special effects start and stopits not moulin rouge and its not in the mood either inspite of the occasional and very similar slow waltz theme altogether and hour too long to tell a simple story,negative
i liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole susan sarandon is such a good actor that she made an interesting strong character out of mediocre writing the true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome,positive
i havent any idea how commentators could regard this as a decent b western or how one commentator said the plot was more cohesive than most nothing could be farther from the truth this movie is one huge non sequitur it is an affront to the noble b western films of the s i have seen many of waynes early lone star and republic westerns and this one is easily the worstthe bad guy is known as the shadow for crying out loud initially the shadows scheme is holding up open sided stage coaches simultaneously his gang rustles all of the cattle in the territory then they decide to move on to bank robbery to do this they need to shoot up the town with a machine gun no explanation of why thats necessary or how he got that neato little toyno single scheme is revealed in enough detail to suggest a plot here the shadow is obviously just a generally bad guy with all kinds of generally evil schemes he imparts his instructions to his gang through a fake wall safe knock knock whos there he is apparently clairvoyant because whenever his henchmen need to talk to him they knock on the wall the safe opens and presto hes there i can just imagine that he has met them face to face and saysi have some secret nefarious instructions to give you about our next evil deed meet me at the wall safe and ill give em to you just why the shadow requires the safe to communicate with his army of outlaws is like most of the elements of this mess never explainedhe has a nifty tunnel to the ol hollow stump across the street from which vantage point various of his baddies perform assassinations he also has a hidden panel not in his secret lair behind the fake safe but out in the main roomwhen not behind the safe he hangs out on his cow less ranch masquerading as rancher matlock we learn that he has murdered the true owners of the ranch two brothers and assumed the identity of one the daughter of the dead brother has recently arrived from s nyc judging by her wardrobe and she apparently never met her real uncle because he dupes her tooif you thought that bad guys always wore black hats and good guys white hats you need to see this movie here the good guys all ditch their hats in favor of white head bands that make them look like they have all suffered head wounds before any shots have been fired its like a game of pick up basketball only wayne has them tying bandanas round their heads instead of just taking off their shirtsperhaps the weirdest of all is the ending immediately after subduing the shadow and his gang we jump far enough into the future to see wayne and his wife the erst while niece on the front porch of their home never mind that there has been scant romance there yak is playing with waynes year old son dressed up in injun garb hiyoo skookum funno thanks to this nonsense wayne went on to become a screen legend only a super star packer or not could surmount this entry in a film resume long live the duke,negative
chang chehs shaolin temple might very well be the highwater mark of the shaw brothers martial arts film cycle this rousing kung fu epic boasts an amazing cast a veritable whos who of the shaw stable though the plot is fairly standard and the fight choreography is superb as usual it is chehs handling of the subject matter that makes this film remarkable and enjoyable the sense of reverence displayed for the history and traditions of the shaolin temple is palpable in every frame not unlike william keighleys paean to the fabled fighting th in that same self titled film or john fords salute to west point in the long gray line chehs shaolin temple is a lovingly crafted ode in that same stylethe cultural correlation i am tempted to make is to compare the shaolin temple to the alamo watching this film will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced many years ago in grade school history when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of those doomed heroes of the alamo at the end of the film you too might be tempted to call out remember the shaolin temple,positive
i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a gay film i am not even gay but i dont see it as a gay film it is a film with a gay character i cant see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ryan states that he doesnt want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone isnt that horrific and sad i highly recommend the film,positive
leonard maltin mustve been watching some other movie though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one he states starts off well then fizzles when its really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire the plot is about as simple as it gets happy mom happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach dad incapacitated in accident mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear lifegood white knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker appearing suddenly the director john sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic kiss me deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the films narrative and speeds off with the top down his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying pretty neat huh when hes especially pleased with his misdeeds there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage barbara stanwyck dont go away she fires back where would i go theyre in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom ishly yeah thats right the friction between them is a hootthere are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones theres one scene where the police who have been chasing after meeker for some time stop stanwycks car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as shes being questioned a he looks conspicuously un masculine in this pose and b i think its safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicionstill a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion,positive
well i was excited at first to download an animated open source movie only to be ruined by a demo reel the animation is excellent the lip syncing is awful and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand whats going on only to realize nothing is going on you feel no emotion for the characters only pity for the creators for wasting their time i have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time this could of been an excellent short film if they had just taken the time to hire a real director im sure everyone over at blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities but sorry guys story telling is what makes a movie,negative
i had seen this movie as a kid and loved it i loved how spunky and full of energy nikki is and how she mostly ruins loudens perfect yuppie life and corrupts him and turns him on to her crazy ways as a kid in the s i saw new york exactly the way it was portrayed in this movie the domain of madonnas character with wild animals running rampant and hideous bald men chasing people around and causing havoc now as an adult i find i love the movie for the same reasons and even more so for the love story woven into the crazy antics of ms nikki finn although i would still love to go anywhere and find an indoor atrium like in this movie pure beauty and genius,positive
as someone who has read all of baroness orczys books and seen most of the movies based on them i must say that the s version with anthony andrews and jane seymour was better than this it was better written and stuck more to the spirit of the story than this one which seemed to go out of its way to involve people getting shot this new adaptation is less light hearted yet does not have as much depth either although there is some good acting the actors did not have much to work with nice costumes though,negative
im not sure if users ought to be allowed to review films after only sitting through half but im afraid i just couldnt stand another minuteif this abject excuse for a film doesnt have the late great gp spinning like a wheel in his grave then i doubt anything willthe excellent review above not a film for parsons fans sums up most of my feelings how dare a second rate director and writer attempt something to which theyre so clearly incapable of delivering what were they thinking where to startthe script i thought id be getting a slice of bittersweet americana what i got was poorly executed slapstick with no cliché left unturned stupid hippy check stupid fat cop check awful plot contrivances check embarrassingly written female characters double check total disregard for the story which youre trying to portray checkafter a while you realize that what youre watching is a soap and not a very well written one at that scene with knoxville scene with ex girlfriend scene with knoxville which hasnt moved on much scene with ex girlfriend which was a bit like the last one and so onthe direction my friends and i decided after some consideration that watching this was like watching a bad episode of quincy or maybe a particularly poor dukes of hazzard thats how bad the direction was terrible jump cuts awful camera work clunky ins and outs to scenes god it was cringeworthy and then i discovered the director was an irishman whos most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy bbc sunday night drama called monarch of the glen trust me its lowest common denominator tv and then it all made sensethe acting are we now so critical that when some random guy from the tv decides to give acting a go if hes not so bad he stinks we applaud his efforts knoxville just about manages to get through every scene poor christina a has no such luck her performance is a car crash though what you do with those lines i dont know the hippy in the hearse oh dear oh dear oh dear have we not moved on since cheech and chongi could go on but i think you get my drift what i would say is that as other reviews have mentioned no one on this film clearly gives a flying damn for the byrds the flying burrito brothers or grams solo work they knew nothing about the american road movie and they certainly give a damn about trying to do anything with an admittedly decent story from rock mythology this film was shallow failed to explore anything and was jaw droppingly unfunny from beginning tooh wait i didnt quite make the end and i suggest you stay away too,negative
i enjoyed this film immensely due to pungent scenes humorous as well as ironic some even tragical believable performances witty dialogue and a heartfelt rendering of what its like or rather c a n be like to be hetero and or homosexual on the lookout for fulfilment of your desires im aware of the paradox here homo a n d hetereosexual this is something the film tackles on end but never uses for caricature if youre as open minded as the people seem to have been who made that film in the end it wont matter to you if those who lie in each others arms are of the same sex or notmr smith from the matrix gives an admirable turn as a gay houses salesman with strange appetites here but thats not the only thing to marvel at enjoy,positive
well ive read the book first and thought wow would this be cool to see in a movie than i started searching and found there was already a movie made of it i bought the movie a week ago on dvd and watched it they did it awfully wrong at first this kid hapiwho isnt any character in the book then the mix between the two books the river god and the seventh scroll than nicolas needing funds while in the book he himself is actually the funder the whole thing about the hyksos is wrong also taila is supposed to have invented the lightweight chariot the whole thing about the tomb is also very wrong there is supposed to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum suction around it the tomb itself was made in a maze with only a possibility to pass if one knows the rules of the ancient boa game there was nothing in the movie about nicolas being english and royan was a coptic christian in the book not a muslimthis list is endless there were only a few things good about the movie the actors which played royan nahood taita boris mick and tessay were well chosen the rest were just parodies of the characters in the book rasfer was the worst it didnt get even close to the character that was in my head while i wrote the book it is such a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such a bad reproduction i wonder why wilbur smith ever gave his permission for this,negative
easily one of the best indian films ever granted thats not saying muchi made this conclusion after a whopping minutes of watching but i can truly say that fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films ive seenbeautiful because of its imagery the best example i can give is the parallelism between the female leadsradha and sita and the characters of the same name in hindu mythology sita for example is the wife of the revered lord ram as legend goes ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a fire to prove her purity sita in response cries and leaves him reuniting with her motherthe earth this story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the indian womennandita das and shabana azmi the word fire all of a sudden has many meanings marriage tradition religion motherhood and probably a few others i didnt catchbrilliant because of its social overtones many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see fireeg my mom who actually loved it why because although fire is an attack on tradition it is also an attack on tradition in other words that is its strength not its weakness traditional conservative social moreswhether indian or canadian or american or whatever are useless if they enslave you gender roles and self denial can both do thisthese are the things i took with me after seeing fire hats off to deepa mehta,positive
the arrival of white men in arctic canada challenges the freedom of a fearless eskimo hunterw s van dyke mgms peripatetic director was responsible for this fascinating look at life in the arctic among the inuit his production was on location filming from april until november although some annoying rear projection effects show that some of the shooting took place back at the studio while considered a documentary at the time we would likely term it a docudrama as it is scripted with an intriguing plot storylinethe film shows the daily life of the eskimo both winter summer and in fact starts in the warmer time of the year without any snow or ice in sight the constant striving for food is depicted and the viewer gets to watch the exciting hunts for walrus polar bear whale caribou the native language is used throughout with the use of title cards the only english is spoken by the fishermen mounties encountered by the eskimo in fact it is the arrival of white men both good bad and the change they make on eskimo society which is a major element in the narrativethis pre code film deals in a refreshingly frank manner with the eskimo moral code particularly with their practice of wife sharing which was an important and completely innocent part of their culture in fact the entire film can be appreciated as a valuable look at a way of life which was rapidly disappearing even in the early snone of the cast receives screen credit which is a shame as there are some notable performances foremost among them is that of ray wise playing the leading role of mala the eskimo wise was an alaskan native of inuit ancestry and is absolutely splendid and perfectly believable in what was a very demanding part as handsome as any hollywood star he would continue acting using the name of ray mala in a sporadic film career often in tiny unbilled roleslovely japanese hawaiian actress lotus long plays malas loyal second wife the names of the fine actresses playing his other two wives are now obscure director woody van dyke steps in front of the cameras as a strict north west mounted police inspector the two decent hearted mounties who must deliver mala to canadian justice are played by joe sawyer edgar dearing both longtime movie character actors danish author peter freuchen upon whose books the film was based has a short vivid role of an evil wooden legged sea captain who unwisely rouses malas icy wrath,positive
this really is a great film full of love and humor it compels the audience to really care about the characters and participate in their journey michael parness managed to assemble a great cast of top players a minor miracle for a first film no doubt they were moved to help him tell this beautiful story david krumoltz carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty natasha lyonne is unpredictable exasperating and yet totally lovable as grace also a great turn by karen black great to see her on the screen again as graces crazed but sympathetic mother there is cutting wit throughout allowing us the relief of laughter when faced with lifes pain the acting is impeccable the editing tight the direction inspired and the music creates a fitting backdrop of mood given the present day hollywood blockbuster craze full of big budgets big names car crashes and special effects max grace is a refreshing departure give yourself a treat and see this movie,positive

being raised at the time this movie was released has probably influenced my shallow mind but still this isnt a bad movie by any means its a movie about a hostage situation involving a prep school populated to some extent by endearing teenage boys who cant seem to get out of trouble whats wrong with that it doesnt have any big special effects but so what who needs special effects cinemas decline began around the same time that special effects were popularized a coincidence i think not it turned movies with potentially good plot and feelings and turned them into a big substance less light show for innocent kids and the self medicated well you know not all movies need special effects about three fourths of the movies on the imdb top are without special effects but almost all of the top grossing movies of all time have some special effects think about it star wars et ghostbusters etc all good movies but the rest of the top grossing movies are usually cliched tripe with non sensical plots and lots of eye candy well some movies dont need ny of that junkexcuse me for going off on a tangent which i normally do but im just so fed up with that special effects junk back to the point toy soldiers is simply a great movie i admit some of the content is a little corny and ripped off but so what every movie rips off another to some extent think of resovoir dogs countless appreciation sites dictate the fact that beloved quentin tarentino who i admit i like has copied many many many movies in the making of his first major film reservoir dogs many say that the entire plot is ripped off almost scene for scene from japanese and chinese gangster movies which mr tarentino loved so much and probably still does sorry once again for the tangenttoy soldiers is fun it has the whole insubordination from teenagers to unwanted members of authority ie hostage takers its fun to see kids take over when theyre being held to something they dont want to do hell teenage angst inspired rebelion was the key topic to a great majority to s comedies plus theres the tension and thrill of having the characters use fire arms and knock out the bad guys etc plus theres some emotional points to the film when one of the characters dies the others have to cope and adjust its not perfect acting but it beats most of the other tripe out therein short toy soldiers is exciting interesting and fun how dare you jaded blowhards rate this movie poorly shame on you allpersonal rating,positive
id never seen a tarzan movie before so when i saw it on the tele i thought id give it a shot unfortunately i have to say i was disappointed tarzan was over years old and somewhat overweight not how id imagined tarzan would look and unless i missed it while making myself a cup of tea tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell also missing was tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vineoh well so much for expectations anyway jane was there the monkey cheeta was there there was some guy with a guitar there there were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable nothing bad you understand but equally nothing goodprobably not the best movie to introduce tarzan,negative
i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke if the ranking had a zero this movie would get it the dinosaurs were awful the storyline was ridiculous the acting really doesnt qualify to be called acting the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was,negative
this film is one that played very well back in and probably wouldnt work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived however if you are the sort person like me who adores older hollywood films you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is an interesting soapthe film is set in a ward for problem pregnancies in this large room are about a half dozen beds in which women are waiting to give birth but doctors are concerned about possible complications yikes such a room would really traumatize the mothers and like an episode of love boat or fantasy island each mother has her own special story with so many rather extreme and crazy stories you have to suspend disbelief i could and enjoyed the film quite a bithere are a few of the stories one involves a father you dont see the mom but he is a very very nervous father and its included for comic relief however he was wonderful here very touchingloretta young and eric linden are a sad case loretta is sent to the hospital from prison she apparently killed some horrible guy you dont know exactly what occurred but you assume he was trying to force himself on her yet she was given a year sentence and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he canglenda farrell is an awful person she has the maternal instincts of a hamster a really really bad and alcoholic hamster she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with gin as well as becoming upset when she learns she cant make money selling her twins late in the film she has a typical hollywood style change of heart that was supposed to be touching i found it contrivedthere is a woman who has given birth to a still born baby amazingly afterwords they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth a crazy woman who you assumed lost a baby some time agowanders down from the psychiatric unit she insists shes having a baby later she escapes again and actually takes one of the kidsthere are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones as i said its a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining and quite sad in the case of several of the stories the ending in particular is heart breaking and exceptionally well done there were a few particularly good performances especially farrell and aline macmahon as the head nurse all in all a very good film and i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later which was typical for warner brothers,positive
i recently saw this movie in my international business class i was not expecting anything other then another boring documentary not to say i dont love documentary ive just hard bad luck with movies in that class imagine my surprise when this movie thats actually a movie came up this film is a tell all of cultural differences in the work place and how they need to cooperate to get anywhere the culture clash shows just how different the world is and just how differently we perceive ourselves until someone comes along and gives us a wake up call i would highly recommend this film to anyone in business or who just wants a laugh because yes it is funny well thats about it cheers,positive
ivan marco ricca and gilberto alexandre borges are partners in a company together with estevo george freire but the first ones contract a professional killer anisio to murder estevo the plot at least at the beginning doesnt explain very well why the guy does it and after receiving his money he starts blackmailing the two partners appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there as supervisor or something at the same time he meets marina mariana ximenes daughter of estevo and starts dating with her in a story like this where crime corruption betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand no one is innocent or can be victimized exception made to marina which is the only person who doesnt know whats going on and didnt betray anyone this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like so paulo where crime is every days presence we can feel irony but also veracity in characters like anisio brilliantly played by paulo miklos which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any scruples and even flirts with the daughter of the guy he killed he really must be a monster to do something like that but of course i know therere people like him out there in brazil or any other place its a very good movie cruel but truthful about a sad reality the acting is great and the soundtrack too,positive

the secret of kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films i have ever seen before watching this film i was convinced that nothing could give up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but i found in kells a serious contenderthe secret of kells tell the story of a young orphan named brendan who lives with his uncle the abbot of kell the abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boys imagination when the legendary brother aidan who looks surprisingly like willie nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once with aislings help he attempts to save the town and help brother aidan complete the mystical book whichlegend has itcan turn dark into lightsee my full review of the secret of kells at theoscarsblogblogspotcom movie review secret of kellshtml,positive

well as goethe once said there really isnt any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of whats been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film certainly should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement however i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people dont watch it its a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i dont mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i dont see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree of course because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree because we see the least of her alexandres affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value of course but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre léaud is most likely not even acting and that with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he along with the director eustache had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout of the film it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow worthless and despicable post milieu what made however this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman sleeping mostly in this very flat with another and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third well i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog eat dog world hes chosen to create for himself what i cant however in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty as i say if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre veronika and marie three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i cant imagine the problem however is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities this latter idea however is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated miserable and alone or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if youre historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post parisian milieu which was probably unfortunately not restricted to just a few particularly anti social types like these but please dont make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have,negative
i liked house of dracula much more than house of frankenstein carradine is much more passable his acting isnt as ridiculous overboard as in hof the actors deliver solid enough performances the subplots eg the monster the village mobsters the village idiot the hunchback nurse etc are mixed in well so that none becomes an odd splinter as in hof better run than the stitched together hof the hunchback nurse is as likable as the hunchback in hof the doctor is very good as well lon chaney adds a classy touch with his wolfman worth watching twice a classic universal horror with that typical s long lost flair especially good is the doctors performance before after his blood had been contaminated with draculas,positive
may contain spoilers for about the last four years ive been a keen fan of ali g sacha baron cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and in my view his best creation is borat whos as funny as hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to peopleanyway to the movie i didnt bother paying money to see this in the cinema i suppose because i didnt expect a lot but when i hired the dvd recently i found the whole thing pretty sad the best part of alis taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe really this movie goes to show i think that some things can run for too long and definitely dont translate to the big screen the movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that ive come to expect from british films where have all the good british movie making ideals gone to that said there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in alis bed and alis audience with hm the q with the shaven haven respect remarkso in summary i am an ali g and borat fan and i have enjoyed many of his interviews notably the one with anita roddick of the body shop but this movie fell really flat with me if theres to be another movie i hope its a whole lot better than this lot of old tripeweasel canberra australia,negative

hard justice is an excellent action movie the whole movie is really nothing but shooting and fighting but it does have a very good vampire plot for the people who say they dont make shoot em ups and fighting films like they use to well this one is really hard core don the dragon wilson is excellent and his character is really cool in the movie nicholas guest was very good as well and he arguably steals the show he really performs as a fantastic villain melanie smith was also good i think that this very fine looking actress is very underrated michael cavanaugh was good it was really cool to see vince murdocco in this film as for the action it is truly awesome with all of the gun fights and the super cool fighting scenes the fighting in this picture is really some of the greatest i have seen there is so much that happens in the minute run time for the action fans you will be blown away by all of the fire power and superb fighting that this film has to offer night hunter is a movie that isnt easy to locate and if you are at a video store and you see it for sale buy it up because this movie is big keeper and plus the box is cool there is a ton of action that has to be seen to be believed look and see if you can find some good deals on ebay halfcom amazoncoms z shops and market place sellers in my opinion night hunter is one of the greatest fighting films that i have ever watched and the characters are so neat if you like don the dragon wilson and want to see nicholas guest in a great performance then i strongly recommend that any action movie fan who loves shoot em ups fighting movies and vampire films and has been disappointed by other movies that has the look of a true non stop action flick but fails to deliver it to get and buy night hunter today,positive
saving grace is never riotously funny but it delivers quite a few good laughs and i enjoyed it to a significant degree brenda blethyn is a fine actress and does a good job at portraying widower grace who resorts to growing marijuana to pay off her massive debts the supporting cast also does a fine job french actor tchecky karyo has a funny little role the premise alone is appealing the idea of an over the hill woman growing and smoking pot sounds funny enough and the film plays around with the premise wisely every now and then of course there are flat moments like one where two elderly women mistaken graces marijuana leaves for tea leaves and they start pulling childish antics at the store where they work that was a mindless gag that didnt quite take off the films tone is downbeat and occasionally dull but i got enough laughs to give this english import a recommendation my score out of,positive
michael winner is probably best known for his revenge themed films such as death wish and chatos land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult horror cinema as the sentinel of proves the sentinel which is based on a novel by john konvitz who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult horror should consider missing the film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as rosemarys baby the exorcist or the omen but as far as i am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even creepierallison parker christina raines is a beautiful young new york model traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend chris sarandon allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also affordable in an old mansion in brooklyn the new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants and the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to alice this may not be an adequate plot synopsis but i would hate to spoil any of this films great moments so i will not give any further plot description what i will say however is that the sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere the fact that director michael winner and writer john konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome the film is imaginatively photographed and the eerie old brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film as mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shock moments and genuine scares the film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb beautiful christina raines is great in her role of allison parker lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind chris sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as christopher walken jeff goldblum jerry orbach beverly dangelo and tom berenger before becoming really famous the cast also includes stars like ava gardner horror icon john carradine burgess meredith and my personal favorite the great eli wallach as a cynical homicide detective ive been a great fan of director michael winner for a long time mostly for films like death wish and chatos land the sentinel is yet another great film in winners repertoire and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard boiled revenge cinema but also of atmospheric occult horror all in all the sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all horror fans,positive
it must be remembered that the gammera movies like many of the first series gozilla films were in fact aimed squarely at kids little kenny and his cohorts are living out the daydreams of the kids in the audience they get to run around and play with top secret stuff while the adults stand by and allow it they get to cavort with monsters and even when the bad guys enter they are never in any real dangerperhaps the first gammera film is an aberration because the child does get punished and is put into danger but the rest of the series is pure wish fulfillmentas one critic said these arent failed adult movies but successful kids movies,negative
i really loved this movie and so did the audience that i saw it with in los angeles after the film lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them i can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland sweden the film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them the music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see even people who dont normally go to subtitled films definitely deserved the oscar nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension in a small town community with everyday people it is a film that unites us in this divided world and shows us the potential of the human spirit a must see,positive
i first read about the left behind series a few months ago and made a mental note to check it out since i have an interest in the way religion is used to control people in our ever more hate filled world so imagine my surprise and joy when i found a copy of left behind world at war in my local library nestling innocently among the big budget action moviesnow as a movie its extremely poor the acting is straight out of an elementary school production and the special effects would have looked dated in the early s being the third part of a series the story would be unintelligible to anyone who hadnt seen or read about the other left behind movies and even with my prior knowledge it was still pretty laughableon the religious front i dont think anyone who wasnt already filled with the spirit of the lord would find anything in the movie to convince them to change their ways how are you supposed to fear the antichrist when hes got a comedy russian accent and the worst of his powers are some pitiful cgihowever my main problem with this movie is the blatant attempt to try and dupe people into believing that its a big budget action movie upon picking up the box and reading the spiel i immediately noticed something oddnowhere on the packaging was there a mention of the true nature of this film to someone not in the know it would appear for all intents and purposed that left behind world at war was no different from the latest tom clancey nor on the copy that i rented did it say anything about it being the third in a seriesconsidering the whole premise of the series is that the antichrist has deceived the whole world i find it extremely hypocritical that the film makers tried to deceive me twice before i even got the to counter if youre so firm in your beliefs then why not be honest about itthe simple fact is had this not been a christian movie with the built in fan base that goes with it i seriously doubt it would ever have seen the light of day if cloud ten were hoping that id see the error of my ways and give myself to god im afraid to say i would have died of boredom and or laughed myself to death before i ever had the chance,negative

we gave up at the point where george clooneys character has his finger nails extracted we were not squeamish having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like to say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over praise it how did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseuds corner of a film let alone nominate it for an oscar clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him what was he thinking oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud dvd or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid air the film was hard enough to follow without that as well i pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available,negative
this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you dont need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons david essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like st movies this is the perfect example of a very st movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth youll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its samuaraitasticit also looks as if it was made in,positive
basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war but there were a couple things that struck me first was the use of mouthed epithets in two cases the scott character mouths one once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb off dammit and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot st i could be wrong about the second instance but i replayed it several times and thats what it looks like to me the third case is when the anne shirley character wishes the obrien character goodbye and good luck give em hell over the roar of the engines she must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says heck i also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing specifically bombing civilians the avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used given what we know about the lemays later strategy of firebombing japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony i remember mcnamaras quoting of lemay in the fog of war something to the effect that if the us did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal the ending is way overwrought in keeping with the movie it reminded me a bit of the end of white heat im not comparing the films just the ending maybe its just cause he gets blowed up blowed up real good,negative
now this is more like it the first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid thoroughly enjoyable hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way throughseriously this is just full of great stuff brimming with creativity and its less of a spoof on s movies at the same time the scenes in hell are great and so are the ones in heaven theres really no shortage to the mad cap adventurous romp that this one promises and you will never see another movie like this even the hammy final act of the movie isnt as bad as the first one being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely cliché repertoire of family fun movie bliss and even keanu reeves despite looking about isnt that bad heresounds like a good deal to me,positive

having seen many of wong kar wais other movies happy together fallen angels ashes of time i knew what to expect coming in to the theatre the cinematography would be lush the use of space and perspective would be varied the acting would be superb and at least one of the characters would be consumed by an ineffable loneliness these are after all precisely the techniques that make wong kar wais art what it is what i was not expecting was the degree to which i was drawn into a film that some reviewers dismissed as unfinished and compelled by characters who seemed consumed by ennuii find it interesting how people can be so utterly unmoved by a film that so vividly displays emotions and settings many of us take for granted or work ardently to forget the overwhelming sense of grief stemming from being betrayed the guilt aroused by the thought of becoming no better than the betrayer the mundane yet profoundly intimate moments of relationships where the need to express oneself verbally is utterly superfluous this is what wong kar wai attempts to portray in the film and what he achieves so welltoo many americans are consumed by the need to have every moment of a film filled with stock dialogue witty banter disaffected sarcasm and overwrought confessions seem to be the pinnacle of the best american film has to offer wong kar wai sees things very differently instead of the character needing to keep the audience apprised of her every feeling perception or belief wongs characters make their feelings and understandings known clearly by facial gestures body positioning and yes silenceif viewers merely contemplate this film from the standpoint of character development and action then they may be disappointed by what it has to offer if they are willing to let themselves try and intuit what the characters are feeling then they may feel quite differently about what wong has to offer them,positive

this movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and i will talk about why but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault not far into the movie oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film i know many will argue that its not that important in a kung fu beat em up and as a fan of the genera i cant say that its all that unusual but that doesnt stop it from being completely tasteless every time i see itwhat i will say in this movies defence however is that its somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts or even action movie of any sort that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police the final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy dog like devotionwhether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not one cant help but feel a little hopeful that oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over this is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated if only karate bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved or by leaving it out all together this would have been a much more interesting film,negative
despite its rather salacious title this is a light teen dramedy unless youre an old coot youll probably find it likeable it isnt so good on developing characters or situations smoothly though when you view it you get the feeling that youve been running back and forth to the kitchen even if youve been sitting down watching the whole time this is one of those films that counts a great deal on your liking the characters and they are appealing enough jennifer connelly is the heartthrob of many i know but ive always liked the more obscure maddie corman the teens get most of the screen time without a lot of intrusions from those pesky grown ups is it just me or did most of the young males look an awful lot alike,positive
to say i was disappointed is an understatement an amateur film made by professionals i was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions something ive never donei was stopped by cloris leachman really she rings true the only one i should say this new women are less modern than the george cukor women of the s this ones are acting for us trying to be with it but their conflict is exactly the same as it has always been in movies anyway the fun of the original was based on a crisp vitriolic and very funny script a masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast all the elements that are missing here tv actresses mingling with models and oscar nominees winners there wasnt anything organic about it the whole thing felt like a put on improvised in the moment without a clear objective,negative
a tedious effort from not yet great director budd boetticher and pretty but not yet un bland actress nina foch this movie is as one of the other reviewers notes is the quintessence of a certain kind of b movie its just not the good kind and a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wastedbasic plot nina a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves has a nightmare she meets a dashing fellow at the resort where shes giving her nerves a breather and realizes hes in the dream even though shes never met him before meanwhile it turns out our dashing guy is working as a spy and is about to go on an extra secret hush hush mission that must not failof course there are nazis and plot holes and smart people acting in a fashion most likely to get them into entirely unnecessary scrapes so that the running time can be spun out past an hour at the end the movie becomes a contest between which group of spies can act more foolishly if the fbi and oss had acted like this crew wed have lost the war in the movie itself is rather flatly shot despite the best efforts of the fog machine and the acting as it seems to be in many of the columbia bs tcm has been showing lately is curiously unengaged its less stylized than what one might find from a similarly budgeted warner bros movie but also less fun to watchboettichers strength of course is a rather matter of fact style which allows the strong stories and acting in his randolph scott westerns to come to the fore maybe the problem here is that such a style is not going to work when the script is lousy and the actors tired from their five film a year schedule,negative
as we are well aware movies are not set out to be a direct incorporation of history but it is a disgrace when a movie is made which has absolutely little to no correlation i wish the director and or the screen writer had done his her research in this topic all this movie does is create a forum for hate between people while causing a rift that should not be there this movie portrayed the sikhs and muslims in a very negative manor while making the third group hindus look as if they were non existent in the brutal killings of the people of both nations the inaccuracies coupled with the sear disregard for ones faith as portrayed by gian singh was a disgrace to the highest format though on a more positive note the actors did a great job in acting in their roles both kristen k and neve c played their rolls exceptionally i hope those that watch this movie do not see or use it as a template for the actual historical event,negative
if you havent already seen this movie of mary kate and ashleys then all i can say is what are you waiting for this is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much its fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise of course as always mary kate and ashley are the main scenery here anyway would any true fan want it any other way of course not anyway its a great movie in every sense of the word so if you havent already seen it then you just have to now i mean right now too so what are you waiting for i promise that you wont be disappointed sincerely rick morris,positive
like almost everyone i am familiar with the music of ray charles who hasnt heard georgia on my mind and the mess around and some of the other marvelous songs featured in this movie but about the life of ray charles i was sadly ignorant until watching this i have to say that jamie foxx brought ray charles to life brilliantly his performance was powerful right down to the mannerisms and voice inflections the movie also offered a no holds barred account of some of the trials and tribulations charles dealt with over the course of his life and with some demons from the past that haunted him well into adulthood perhaps the most powerful scene in the movie was the heroin withdrawal scene which was painfully realistic the movie portrays charles growing awareness of and involvement with the civil rights movement culminating in his refusal to play before a segregated audience in georgia which led to a ban on him performing in the state his drug addiction and extra marital affairs are also well documented the movie revolves around a plea from his mother when he was a child dont let anyone or anything turn you into a cripple the point is that drugs did just that and to honour his mothers memory he had to beat them theres not much here about his later life and career after breaking his heroin habit but up to that point this is really powerful stuff,positive
i have loved this movie since i saw it in the theater in i was then and wil wheaton was my favorite actor and adolescent crush i am now and i still love this movie the best part about it is whoever i am dating loves it too because it is a total macho guy movie it is wrought with enough action and mayhem to keep men with the shortest attention spans glued to the screen i only wish that it was available on dvd,positive
what more could i say the americans totally hated it because the us cut was so bad although you could detect the underlying goodwill in ittalking about the us theatrical releasealong with the newly released blu ray disc version its faster and tighter than hk cut the background musics were all changed from the dark grim hk musics to hip hop musics and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out though the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actors voice and tone but the problem is hak hapblack mask the movie was designed and meant to be dark grim super disturbing and totally gruesome very unfortunately the us release just skimmed the cream they wanted which in return completely changed the movies undertonehk release was rated to be even more comical and amateurishnow lets talk about the original hk release this movie is like a hidden gem a prototype for the whole matrix tide and era the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit old school among hk movies however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture with all the leather black costumes and decorations this movie features a batman like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child but it works its so impressive that the whole movies gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats in year they made a sequel which had a pg rating but without jet li and liu qing yun and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship and did i happen to mention francois yip her roundhouse kick was totally cool even cooler than the villain boss because she didnt use a stuntman for all the fighting did i mention she was also smoking hot anyway there are a lot of things to like about the moviehowever the movie also suffered from a lot of problems first off its a mediocre script made at its best potential which means this production team deserved a better screen writer there are a lot climaxes in the entire minutes but they often felt like far fetched and dont totally make senses to the audiencesus version was even worse because all the character developments were cut anyway you cant ask too much out of a comic inspired action movie also this movie is entirely improper for children i wont recommend it to you if you are less than years old its saturated with disturbing contents including blood gore sado maso costumes extreme brutal violence and so on along with the style of the movie it can be called a wet dream for heavy metal rock music fans and action fans the us cut was milder but if you want to see it see the hk release for what it is status inspiring hidden undervalued adult,positive
forgive me but this work of director peter hall is horrendous if you cant get to us with the plot why not kill someones cat or dog that surely reaches the audiences this viewer is tired of seeing animals sacrificed for the plot of a movie and believe me i saw it coming before she opened the package how predictable can you get take a cute animal then kill it in a gruesome way i have never been a fan of de mornay and this performance tells me why overacted and somewhat stagnant in interpretation i found her rather silly and definitely boring i did like banderas but felt bad that he had to play opposite de mornay he has done much better in other films namely philadelphia where he had some honesty in his dialogue in this chestnut he did his best to keep his character real but the writers green rush did a good job in preventing this with their trite storyline and insipid dialogue please let us not be subjected to this kind of entertainment some of us arent fooled by corny plots bludgeoning animals and generally long winded dialogue seeing her get away with it made me furious,negative
farewell friend aka adieu lami honour among thieves isnt perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed french algerian war veterans alain delon and charles bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the christmas weekend naturally things arent quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns on the debit side theres a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park bronson has a very irritating fonzie like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments brigitte fossey sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a liability her ill cook spaghetti ill learn to make love well ill read shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways and its a shame about the horrible last line shot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number thats worth checking out if you can find a decent printcinema clubs uk dvd only offers the english soundtrack but since delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed thats no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality,positive
some movies are not for everyone this accurately describes igmar bergamans movie skammen shame at only i still have what i guess you could call a minor form of add and well i watch movies to be entertained shame was a movie with a very interesting premise of trying to convey the effect of war on the common people it however fell short of accomplishing this for me i dont know if it was the subtitles black and white filming length of the movie or the fact that it took two hours out of my studying for a huge chemistry test but i did not enjoy it i understand it is considered a great movie and very important in the history of cinema however i think as my teacher pointed out not everyone has liked or likes it i guess i just wish it finished all of its many side plots maybe the translation lost something but i felt there were infinite little off shoots that never met a conclusion you would meet characters and never see them again or really understand why they were included in the movie my overall recommendation for this movie is that its worth seeing but only to form your own opinion on it whether or not you like or dislike it it is necessary to respect the point that it is trying to convey,negative
i recall so many things about seeing this movie back during its original theatrical release the post woodstock afterglow of peace and love along with the pre watergate tension of fear and paranoia its hard to believe that its thirty seven years later and i can still remember the thoughts going through my head while watching the film with my best friend like marveling at peter boyles characterization of the ultimate redneck sure to typecast him the rest of his career oh how wrong and how the counter culture jarred the sensibilities of most of the country to this day my buddy and i still use joe currans line from my summary above when faced with a dilemma curious how a simple line like that can stay with you for decadesits curious to read comments about the film from others on this board particularly the ones stating that the film has a dated quality and how over the top the characters were still if you were around during that time the picture gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the polar opposites that existed back then pretty much side by side as the events in the story reveal if you really want dated when was the last time you heard the words macys and gimbels in the same sentence or a line like joes come on get with the pepsi generation for historical perspective you have that great nixon poster lingering in one of the background scenes would you buy a used car from this man with minor intricacies like those director john avildsen captures many of the subtle but ever present hints of how life was four decades agotodays viewing was only the second time ive seen the movie and i have to admit i dont remember susan sarandon in one of the lead roles but then again this was her very first picture the scenes of nudity and free love were something actually quite new and bold at the time shocking in fact as film makers began to experiment with their ability to push the envelope of propriety and convention joe took a major leap in that regard particularly since it was a mainstream picturewith the passage of time the thing that impresses me the most about peter boyle was how he overcame the stereotype of joe curran to appear in or star in some of my very favorite pieces of work i mean how do you go from joe to that hilarious rendition of puttin on the ritz in young frankenstein and my absolute favorite episode of x files has boyle as clyde bruckman in both a tender and tragic funny and serious portrayal that turns the tables on scully and mulder more than once and as a career capper frank barone has to be one of the funniest characters in the history of television even repeat episodes in syndication are funny as he whenever the elder barone lets loose with one of his observations he is one actor that this viewer sorely misses already,positive
there is no real story the film seems more like a fly on the wall drama documentary than a proper film so this piece may in itself be a spoiler teen drama about young singaporean kids very similar to uk chavs who play truant from school run with gangs get into fights insult people on the street get tattoos hang about doing nothing etc etc they generally imagine themselves to be hard and every so often shout challenging rap chants into the camera filmed in mtv style fast cuts crazy camera angles tight close ups and animation interludes the dialogue might have been crisper in the original languages of mandarin and hokkien than in the subtitles and i have no doubt that some of the contemporary singapore references will slip over western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless of course you are familiar with singapore this kind of teen film may be a first for singapore but it has been done before and done better in other western countries la haine for example,negative
the first time i saw this episode was like a shock to me it was actually the first time i saw the speed things are happening is amazing and its so surprising thrilling and even interesting its almost as if you are reading a book once you start it its very hard to stop from the minute richard walsh was talking privately to jack about the possibility that they have a mole inside ctu i was sitting hours which means episodes sounds funny and crazy but im the kind of guy which when he is interested he just cant stopthis series is one of the best of its kind and its build in a way of having a few different stories that are being connected together recommended in every way,positive
chop shop is a hidden treasure out in theaters i cannot begin to describe how wonderful the performances are in this movie this film is for anyone who wants to watch a powerful story and see an example of what contemporary movies should look and be likethis film is about a young boy alejandro ale who works and lives with his teenage sister isamar izzie in a one room tiny loft in an auto shop the story takes place in a part of new york city that i did not even know existed willits points where there are endless junkyards and body shops here bahrani tells the story of two forgotten children hoping to support themselves by buying and fixing up a food vanale makes money helping at the auto shop and izzie helps at a food van both however earn extra money on the side ale sells bootleg movies and stolen car parts izzie results to selling herself their lives are surrounded by grit and grim but even though both witness live and barely survive within their harsh world their love for each other is never tainted by the filth that surround them and occasionally they are able to laugh and enjoy moments of their childhood that is being stolen by the reality of struggling to survive and stay togetherthe best comparison i have for chop shop is that bahranis juxtaposition of an innocent love between family members against such a bleak atmosphere is as powerful as pasolinis mama roma combined with the struggles of growing up too fast in an adverse environment just as in bressons mouchettehaving co written directed and edited both this film and his first man push cart which won awards all over the world bahrani is a total package filmmakeri can only hope that his films will not be hidden treasures for long,positive
i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable i can see why it hasnt been rebroadcast anytime recently more specifically this mini has some serious problems such as it is terribly miscast the actors who played the younger generation were all to years older than the characters ali mcgraw at the time was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about jan michael vincent at the time was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about the other henry children and pamela tudsbury were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their s some of the acting was absolutely awful ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays the directing was poor to be fair to ali mcgraw the bad acting and character development were probably the directing the portrayal of hitler was way overdone his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic sometimes charming but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel some of the other characters are done so stereotypically berel jastrow they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them this mini is very dated the hokey music the pretentious narration it sounded like a junior high school history film narration and the entire prime time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times also too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in rather than someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all because it will come off more as a late s early s take myself too seriously prime time soap drama rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classicremakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning memorable and critically acclaimed production i dont ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long hours or longer to do it right and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public it wouldnt fly,negative
the poet carne disappears didnt he disappeared with prévert and is followed by the judge carne the director wants to give his own vision of a youth that he doesnt understand and he doesnt want to its a long way from the wonderful les enfants du paradis,negative
i saw this movie when i was a little girl and i have enjoyed it every time sure the graphics are a little cheesy compared to now but back in the s it was great i saw it in the original spanish version only and thought it was wonderful that was how i remember my christmases were with my family magical santa claus was amazing and i couldnt wait for him to come back each yearif you have a child children and speak spanish bring them up watching this old fashioned version of santa claus its a different version than we are used to today but who says there is one wayits a fun movie to watch it teaches children good vs bad i dont know how the english subtitled version is or if there is an english one of this but the spanish is the best enjoy and happy holidays feliz navidad,positive
mr baseball is a film of paradoxes written and filmed as a light sports comedy it truly has a heartwarming core as human and universal as some of capras finest at the plot level you have the paradox of baseball a fine old american game as it is played in japan turned around with american values cast off and japanese values imprinted upon the game some of the superficial sports comedy results from jacks uncomprehending disbelief at how basa boru is played in japan you also have a lead character whos presented as an over the hill aging baseball star but who is actually quite immature pro ball allowed him to postpone growing up and you have a lead character who is rudely resistant to the changes in his life that are being forced upon him refusing to accept the curveball that life has given him in the midst of a new country a new manager a new team and a new girlfriend who have all welcomed him and try to accept him sound like heavy stuff not really its a charming clash of cultures comedy that takes place on the national sports romantic and professional levels but if you watch it sensitively enough you will also find a great story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow up way too late in life causing some amount of personal pain and finds success in places he never expected it i love the story but i also have great respect for sellecks performance he bares his tush literally to portray an ugly american insulting people and throwing tantrums in public then lets us inside this character to understand his dismay it also doesnt hurt if youre a big fan of takakura ken like i am mr baseball is a surprising loss of innocence tale,positive
what should i say i only saw this flick for curiosity and this is truly a shame i grew up in brittany with stories of celtic legends and spent years in rennes the town in which this film is said to take place shame that not any actor nor camera from this flick ever arrived in rennes they could at least have chosen a likely town or a likely forest but nothing even seem like brittany nor rennes and calling it a film about celtic legends is really making a fool of the audience besides those details it could have been a good film but its crap silly scenario silly characters and no originality definitely to avoid,negative
in japan and elsewhere in europe new technology is enabling filmmakers to bypass the closed shop of the hollywood mainstream and avoid ed wood like visible low budget production values to produce compelling films what a shame that in the uk we can find examples such as avatar name of many a video game where brain dead attempts are made to imitate so many films and console games beloved of girlfriendless teens that themselves are cheap photocopies of clichés abound like testosterone fuelled kangaroos check out a bit of the synopsisset in futuristic london it tells the story of a team of virtual reality virus exterminators faced against the ultimate internet virusgo back and read that quote again avoid guffawing and try to find a single original idea in it this should have seemed a tired sad concept in never mind ah but there is more the ultimate virus has already caused planes to crash infected the air traffic control centre etc it has been developed by a child genius and manifests itself as a scantily clad athletic mammary jiggling discount lara croft imitator who does a great line in snarling and cod martial arts moves straight out of the playground the living product of adolescent fantasy oh and she is accompanied by predator like sound effects to emphasise her remarkable powersthe whole thing has a futuristic vision of stunning originality the lloyds building filtered with aftereffects to look somewhat green the budget does really show which in this day and age should not on the whole a pointless mess of cheese ham and cliché that roger corman would have left on the cutting room floor in his most shameless desperate moments shame that such an alleged labour of love delivered nine minutes of wasted celluloid,negative
id honestly give this movie a solid but i clicked to try to offset the pages of imbecilic unjustified star reviews this is an interesting story all of the acting is good to very good even ms diaz who is totally out of her usual grinning bimbo role here yet plays it well the sets are perfect and the cinematography is consistently appropriately creepy its a fine morality play and there is no reason to explain the origin of the god supernatural being alien whatever thats running the show so im glad the movie doesnt try its really irrelevant to the story which is relatively long but quite compelling and summed up quite satisfyingly in the ending before you decide this movie is terrible or really anything under a read some of the dozens of star hated it reviews that are rife with misspellings lack of punctuation and capitalization and juvenile criticisms maybe the trailer was misleading or something i didnt see it but some of these reviewers were apparently expecting terminator or saw one reviewer actually compared this movie to saw how utterly inappropriate and unrelated seriously most of these reviews read like you tube comments according to these critics this movie is too confusing yet too predictable not enough action yet theres too much going on too smart yet too dumb explains too much yet leaves too much unexplained oh and its apparently a waist sic of time do consider the quality and source of the reviews before taking them to heart im afraid these star kids failed to understand the phrase altruism coefficient and were therefore utterly incapable of understanding the movies premise despite adamantly claiming that they get it right before explaining how confusing it was if you know what those two words mean you will have no trouble understanding and enjoying this moviei really wish there were a reviewer reputation system here so i could be sure to ignore the rating of everyone who gave this movie star foreversee it for yourself and enjoy the fine presentation of an interesting couple taking an interesting moral test and facing the consequences its a good time in my opinion,positive
one of the all time great science fiction works as visionary and thought provoking as blade runner or even gilliams own brazil willis gives his best performance here but hes outdone by pitts incredibly frenetic turn thats unlike anything hes done before or since even stowe isnt out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten,positive
not bad performances whoopi plays the wise warm role quite well still the storyline and situations can not be believed forced pc stereotypes at times it is good jews and blacks vs the evil white christians ho hum a typical hollywood fantasy the film does have its moments but it is not one that i would recommend to go out of your way to view,negative
well if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting and if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go and if you set aside the fact that i didnt find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting well if you set all that aside this is still a really terrible moviei take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy poor girl i never really understood for a moment how this romance between kelley chris klein and samantha leelee sobieski ever got started the inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between klein and sobieski the screenplay by michael seitzman is dull to the point of stupefying how seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievabledid i mention that this is a really really terrible movieid give it a zero but the imdb doesnt provide for votes of zero so i give it a one while holding my nose,negative
i dont know how or why this film has a meager rating on imdb this film accompanied by i am curious blue is a masterworkthe only thing that will let you down in this film is if you dont like the process of film dont like psychology or if you were expecting hardcore pornographic rammingthis isnt a film that you will want to watch to unwind its a film that you want to see like any other masterpiece with time attention and caresummaries may contain a spoiler or twothe main thing about this film is that it blends the whole film within a film thing but it does it in such a way that sometimes you forget that the fictions arent realthe film is like many films in one a political documentary about the social system in sweden at the time which in a lot of ways are still relevant to today interviews done by a young woman named lena a narrative about a filmmaker vilgot sjoman making a film he deals with a relationship with his star in the film and how he should have never got involved with people hes supposed to work with the film that vilgot is making its about a young woman named lenaie who is young and very politically active she is making a documentary ie she is also a coming of age and into her sexuality and the freedom of thatthe magnificence and sheer brilliance of i am curious yellow blue is how these three elements are cut together in one moment you are watching an interview about politics and the next your watching what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes but does that so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrativeanother thing is the dynamic between yellow and blue which if you see one you must see the other blue is not a sequel at all ill try to explain it best i can because to my knowledge no other films have done it though it is a great techniquethink of yellow as a living thing actual events in scenes a complete talethink of blue as all the things in between the scenes in yellow that you didnt see that is a complete tale on its ownessentially they are parallel films the same story told in two different waysit wasnt until i saw the first minutes of blue that i fully understood yellowi hope this was helpful for people who are being discouraged by various influences because this film changed the way i looked at filmthanks for your time,positive
i just watched lonesome dove return to lonesome dove streets of laredo and dead mans walk all excellent this sorry hunk of junk is cheaply done and poorly actedin the previous series captain call and gus mccrae come off as tough respectable cowboys despite the fact that caption call is played by a different actor every time each one quickly won me over in dead mans walk the boys are believable as the younger versions of the experienced texas rangers in comanche moon they are just a couple of chubby rednecks i had to stop watchingi suspect many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by the people who made this stinking pile its a sorry end to an otherwise great franchise,negative
hello this is my first review for any movie i have seen i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally the most disgusting movie i have ever seen i feel like the movie was porely made which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw which i can agree saw as well is also very graphic but i did like the movie sawthe scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen the scene lasted almost forever well actually it was probably around min but still i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good this director uwe boll and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one one final note haha for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death letting rot with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie if not and you like horror go with a higher budget film like saw for example i cant believe people actually make movies like this anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart this is just my opinion on the movie,negative
i saw this film opening weekend in australia anticipating with an excellent cast of ledger edgerton bloom watts and rush that the definitive story of ned kelly would unfold before me unfortunately despite an outstanding performance by heath ledger in the lead role the plot was paper thinwhich doesnt inspire me to read our sunshine there were some other plus points the support acting from edgerton in particular assured direction from jordan confirming his talent on show in buffalo soldiers as well and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the australian bush much as the irish immigrants of the early th century must have seen it but i cant help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an australian folk hero or was hein what i suspect is a concession to hollywood and selling the picture in the us oh well at least jordan and the producers didnt agree to lose the beards just to please universalguess i will just have to content myself with peter careys excellent secret history of the kelly gang,negative
who really wants to see that disgusting violence disgusting sex for such a long time i do not want to but i always stayed true to my philosophy to watch any movie as bad as it may be this was the hardest right after next fridayits basically just crap how can you possibly call it anything else the story of a roman emperor as an excuse for gore and ta yeah yeah hey its realistic they have been like this fine but why bother us with it i dont care if it has been like this and there are a lot of scenes where i truly doubt it the point is why should anyone wanna see it problem is there is only one reason you could like the film and that would be that you like violence theres nothing special about it just cruelty you can say cool as youd say in splatter slasher movie but horror movies with violence at least can give you chills and excitement maybe characters you care about but here everything is dark dull and boring every character is mad the story of an emperor who cant deal with his power what in the very first scene he runs naked through the woods with his sister i have no problem saying that we saw a madman for hoursbut maybe you get turned on by seeing helen mirren being pregnant and dancing or minutes of hardcore scenes that some people see as the message of the movie or castration yeah right that was fun real birth scenes how hilarious humans animals who cares lets just treat them as toysi dont care what anyone says this is no movie this is just hours of blood and sex degrading and disgusting go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence at least those movies dont pretend to be some artistic masterpiece and they are shorter,negative
the first thing you see in this film is a static angleone which will be repeated later in the film depicting the chaos going onunseen to the audience in a studio that airs news soon after fondas characters typical story is shown in that same angle dont let this mislead you the film is not about a female reporter a woman struggling to succeed in a male dominated profession that is merely a lead in a way of starting the filmthough its used later the actual point to this production is revealed gradually and the first we see of it is in a deliberately long scene early on the entire film has that pace not slow or drawn out but deliberate its never really fast even in the few sequences that one would normally expect to be so this pacingespecially because it seems to slow down further as the plot is revealed as the disturbing unsettling nature of the film is unraveled is strong almost painful to the viewer it inspires you to if it had been possible jump into the screen grab the people responsible by the collar and yell at them to do something about it to remedy the situation never once did i feel like getting up or even taking my eyes off the screen for a moment the subject is extremely important to be aware of and its handled perfectly here no over dramatizationwell very little anyway just an accurate presentation of the issue the direction is astounding the empathy felt for lemmons character is profound the editing is masterful one scene near the very end illustrates that perfectly the editor judging from his filmography is vastly underrated the writing was excellent the acting was great in particular by lemmon fonda and douglaswho also produced it the lack of a score is perfect no music is needed to enhance the ending is sublime and effective the movie does have a few negative points among them some of the dialog is obviously and undeniably mainly exposition one particular part of the film whilst dramatic doesnt seem to mesh with something that follows it not everyone will watch the film because of two features of it which are commonly and rightfully so attributed to bad movies the pacingwhich can be mistaken as being slow and the lack of score one could argue that to be a negative thing as everyone ought to consider the points it presents but maybe its better this way handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respectfor the topic as well as the viewer something like this maybe it shouldnt be spoon fed i was mesmerized with the film and left very taken aback i recommend this to anyone who believe themselves strong enough to handle it,positive
a terminally dull mystery thriller which may sound pretty sound theoretically but plays out very poorly the ludicrous script is full of minor spoiler people dying and then coming back to life when the plot requires them to and the director doesnt seem able to work up any energy and suspense the gooey sequence that kind of explains the films title is the only halfway memorable one in this tiresome film,negative
i saw this on the accent underground release with the short films i found the film at first boring and old fashioned and switched it off after the first hour i was a little drunk and tiredi went to bed and no kidding i had a nightmare about this film within half and hour of falling asleep i couldnt stop thinking about why so i got up switched the tv back on loaded the dvd and saw the rest of the moviewell done alex frayne sir youve managed to implant your film into this old cynical movie goers head and that takes doing so out of to youi cant say i love this film of yours but it has made a lasting impact despite its flaws and low budget etc,positive
of all the adaptations of books by alistair maclean i feel that this qualifies as the worst but dont blame maclean it would appear that all that this film shares with the novel is the same title we have no suspense no sense of foreboding of mystery no chance to really empathize with the main characters we spend the entire duration or at least i did waiting for charlotte rampling to shed her clothing for charlotte this appears to take a remarkably long time still a glimpse of charlotte ramplings tits really cant save this disastrous film maclean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the sniping of those bitter hacks and nit pickers who would appear to blame him for all the ills that befall attempted filming of his books poor old alistair must have crawled into a corner and whimpered when this one came out at least bear island which also uses the maclean name but apparently none of his novel was a little exciting the excitement here is in waiting for the final credits,negative
this may not be the very worst movie peter sellers ever did i think that laurel goes to the prisoner of zenda but it is surely the most depressing sellers especially sans makeup as nayland smith looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy as fu manchu he looks hardly better and spends most of the film with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup the supporting players also look tired and run down and sid caesers presence is offensive even without his constant references to chinks one bright spot this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray asians so insultingly or for that matter star a non asian as one the film seems surprisingly cheap with soupy photography and drab sets even the whiz bang elvis number at the end looks cut rate only the stunning helen mirren and the tall thin nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair all in all this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comics death and an even eerier documentation of his dying,negative
i gave it an only because it had received such low votes this is definitely really about a ummm it was kind of bloody had likeable shallow characters and it had some really hot babes in it i like the eclectic killer because he didnt kill people the same way everytime that sometimes gets old,positive
the series does not start as it means to go on although its first two seasons are crammed with incredibly average episodes as well as numerous duds afterwards the pace picks up and one of the finest space operas is born the first ever episode of star trek the next generation is remarkable for two things its hugely enjoyable introductions to all of the main cast and marina sirtis peculiar accent which would later disappear seeing how it all began is very satisfying and viewed in mind of the rest of the series rather moving actually otherwise it is a very mediocre episode featuring q and some giant jellyfish thats right,negative
i was thinking that the main character the astronaut with the bad case of the runsin his case his skin hair muscles etc could always get more movie work after hed been reduced to a puddle all he has to do is get a job as the blob the premise of this flick is pretty lame an astronaut gets exposed to sunspot radiationi think and so begins to act like an ice cream cone on a hot day not only is this a puzzler but apparently he has to kill humans and consume their flesh so that he can maintain some kind of cell integrity huh have you ever noticed that whenever any kind of radiation accident or experiment happens the person instantly turns into a killing machine why is thatthe astronaut lumbers off into the night from the secret facilitywhich has no security whatsoever shedding parts of himself as he goes apparently he retains just enough memory to make him head for the launch pad maybe because he wanted to return to space thus begins the part of the movie thats pretty much filler with a doctor wandering around with a geiger counter trying to find the melting man by the buzz he gives off he kills a stupid bill gates look alike fisherman scares a little girl a la the frankenstein monster movie and finishes off a wacky older couplepunishing them karmically for stealing some lemons then theres a short scene where he whacks his former general and a very long scene where he kills a young pothead and chases his girlfriend around youd think that after she cuts his arm off and he run away the scene would shift but nowere treated to about ten minutes of the woman huddled into a corner panting and screaming in terror even though the monster is gone all i could think wasdirectors girlfriend anyonethe end of the movie is even lamer than the rest of it the melting man finishes turning into a pile of goo and thennothing thats it thats the end of the movie well at least that meant that there was no room for a sequel,negative
this film is all right fairly silly and to be taken lightly but what i cant stand are the numerous heroes and that boys illegaly sentimental comment near the end look they all look the same isnt that by far passing the good taste standards i thought it was revolting as were the heroic unselfish acts by some of the people in this film im not saying it wont happen like that but zooming in on all the bravery like that makes my stomach churn,negative
the moral of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair bad taste in clothes bad posture bad jobs and on and on they are obviously miserable and loathe themselves however if they learn to eat broccoli they will be wealthy successful and attractive tlc ought to be ashamed of themselves for this blatant exploitation of parental fears and guilt if nutrition is really that important they should be able to develop a show using honest and truthful methods if they really believed in their computer simulations id like to see them do a double blind test by finding some year olds finding out what their eating and exercise habits were as children and age progressing the kids photos then compare to the real things hey that sounds like a project for mythbusters discovery channel are you listeningtlc must stand for tabloid lies and cons,negative

lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to disturb us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different dumblands reward is absurd comedy earned by enduring stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode i just started watching on fast forward didnt miss a thing i felt relieved when it ended and thats part of the point with this series its an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make dumbland worthwhile,negative
i watched this movie last night and already i am struggling to recollect very much about it the story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony they fly to the moon in a space age dustbin carrier when there they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the moonbaseit strikes me that rubbish low budget sci fi films often involve either desert planets or like this movie criminals escaping from penal colonies why this is i have no idea but i can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical this one is really no exception it begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half way alright dance music soundtrack it then degenerates into a boring sci fi thriller so little of consequence actually happens in this movie that i am literally struggling to write a helpful review so if youre reading this i apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the films subtleties and nuances for the record i recall a tedious bunch of baddies a tedious bunch of goodies some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman other than that im strugglingif you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then i would not hesitate to recommend this film i would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets,negative
we see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl but whatever he tries they wont stay open after this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences so is she back from the grave seeking revenge oh what a great and always spooky story well thats what i hoping i could say and hoping was as good as it got this is an forgettable so so supernatural horror flick that i actually watched before but i went in thinking it was my first viewing so to my surprise it hit me when i started picking up on certain things but like i said its quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again nightmare is just another type of its field that adds a few changes to the gruel oh please give me something thats a bit more fresh it doesnt have to be entirely original but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired j horror flick even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right an evil looking vengeful chick spiritbut in spite of my negativity of it being the same old same old story and jolts this one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals the deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality while the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with its murky lighting the first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood curdling experience but really when its not trying to shock you i found it rather coma inducing and i thought about getting some shut eye that might be harsh but it just didnt go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments you could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self centred bunch that you dont really care what happens to them the disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship it just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax its just plain ludicrous the films haunting ending is a high point thoughthe film looks fine although it could have done without the snazzy quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood the performances tread a fine line but gyu ri kim is strong in the lead roleits nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills although i found the handling of it rather lethargic despite the odd effective chills a standard effort all round i guess but still its equally missable,negative
this film has some really impressive action scenes the humor and action are blended well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end the last scene is a slight anti climax in terms of action quality and astonishing explosiveness of the scenes preceding it the humor doesnt seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other hongkong movies and this film is of totally other class than most american action comedies of recent years lau ching wan acts as a typical intuitive police hero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors the dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang humiliating the police force while providing a serious dose of lead poisoning with a variety of machine guns leaving plenty of corpses in its wake yu rong guang is especially impressive as an ultra cool merciless gangster in this woo like piece of action where tough guys are truly die hard,positive
this is one of the most overlooked gems hollywood has ever produced a young wwii british fighter ace whose plane is about to crash has radio contact with a young american woman who comforts the brave pilot knowing that within minutes he will be dead for some reason the man who should certainly be dead walks away from the wreckage and eventually learns that he was meant to report to heaven when a messanger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven the man refuses and demands to have his day in court to argue his case the man argues that his situation had changed during the final moments of his earthly life that he had fallen in love and therefor had become a different person one who deserved a chance to live on the heavenly court is a cinematic delight the announcement of the jury of peers is a definite highlight the story as fantastic as it seems is an engaging one and will keep you spellbound for the nearly hours play time the final scene is simply beautiful and will require a kleenex treatment for most viewers this film is in my personal all time favorite top it has my highest recommendation,positive
it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differencesthis anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death walters story lacks the betrayal and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent instead the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all oddsmy primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga but that it does such a poor job,negative
clint eastwood has definitely produced better movies than this but this one does not embarrass him dirty harry catches everyones attention and unless one wants to watch romance there is no reason why you wont like him he is cool because he is dirty is great because he kills without much thinking is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesnt carefrom what i have seen in movies in which eastwood acts the character of the lead role always captivates the audience in white hunter black heart he is the crazy director in in the line of fire he is the old un while here is the almost jobless with his job that is to say he makes work for himself doesnt care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacationbased on a rape victim this movie is promising for all the no non sense movie watchers the movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot however what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not as it is far too obvious from the beginning it is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving also there are too many people far dirtier than dirty harry,positive

this anime is a must see for fans of evangelion its an earlier work of anno hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place also those who didnt like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable gunbuster is rather unique to sci fi anime in that its actually based on real science in fact the show has several little science lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed the main character remains age or throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one on an interesting note gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes however they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway the ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i couldnt help but love it gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of anime around,positive

this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it its a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen each one with no apparent connection to the next i rented this movie because im a david bowie fan and i really appreciate musicals in finality bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired the moral of the story was really befuddling i couldnt tell if it was about racial issues in london in the s or about not selling out for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the no selling out message when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up maybe i rented half of two different movies nope there was a keep britain white song and dance sequence im sorry but wwii is not something you can write a musical about at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as i have several times in this review overall id say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors and put david bowie in it for longer goddammit my grade c,negative
tough luck follows a homeless drifter as he becomes entangled in the underground crime world of deception and chaos archienorman reedus has been released from prison and has nothing to lose he is almost killed before the owner of a carnival named ikearmand assante hires him for work soon ike discloses a strong desire for archie to murder his mischievous wife divanadagmara dominczyk an erotic dancer for the carnival things soon get complicated when archie falls in love with divana and warns her of the scheme they become involved in a very steamy affair that leaves little to the imagination of the viewer after which they soon make a plan together they plot to murder ike but things dont go quite as plannedi would be lying if i said that this film didnt surprise me i was personally blown away by how good this film was upon renting it several years back i was expecting another cliché thriller with a lot of the typical elements and themes that are shown in a lot of films of that type these days within minutes i was hooked and found myself quite involved with the world of this film its the kind of film much like buffalo that just sucks you in and transports you into the style and the feeling of paranoia it is a film that really pulls it off in stunning fashion one thing i particularly appreciated was how the film depicted its characters the film isnt as easy and clear cut as it may appear in the plot summary these are characters that you actually grow to care about and are fascinated by including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys in truth there are no good guys or bad guys in this film all of the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true to life there arent many films that manage to accomplish this task as flawlessly as this film does but its definitely a film style that i like and i want to see more of from films today there were quite a few crime films that were like that back in the early s but there hasnt been one as gripping and unique as this ever since in terms of flaws i have mostly very minor gripes the film itself isnt exactly original however i doubt that most folks would expect it to be original the films editing style also may be irritating to some folks as it tends to have a camcorder type of shaky cam throughout while i wasnt bothered by it and actually felt that it added to the atmosphere im sure most viewers will not be as enthralled by it and may find it generally off putting despite the minor flaws however this is one of the most underrated films of the s its so refreshing to get lucky and watch an unknown film that turns out to be good it seems as if this film was a direct to video release though this film is far better than that had it been put in theaters it wouldnt have won any awards nor would it have been seen much but it would have a lot more recognition than it has today recognition that this film deserves tough luck is an astounding entertaining and twisted neo noir thriller with a real sense of class and style juxtapose and with enough substance to make the average moviegoer more than simply satisfied,positive
the vampire bat is set in the small german village of klineschloss where gustave schoen lionel belmore the burgermeister is holding a meeting with inspector karl brettschneider melvyn douglas from the local constabulary about all the recent murders six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks brettschneider doesnt have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire brettschneider isnt convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat meanwhile the latest victim martha mueller rita carlyle has been found brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible if it is hows he going to stop itdirected by frank r strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic pictures to cash in on the success of its two stars atwill wray their success in the previous years doctor x is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative enticing title may have lead you to believe quite frankly its rather dull the script by edward t lowe jr takes itself rather seriously sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers that something could possibly be a vampire then for most of its duration the film focuses on brettschneider his incompetent investigations which are not to put too fine a point on it boring the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesnt quite know what it wants to be the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci fi there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the characters are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat i know its old but thats not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since a bland flat dull boring misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesnt cut it these days just look at the original king kong released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today i didnt like it i doubt many modern film goers would either its as simple straight forward as thatdirector strayer doesnt do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of its age as a whole its pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff there isnt much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house universals european set on their back lot are nice add a certain ambiance to thingstechnically the vampire bat cant compare to anything even remotely modern for the age of it its alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong speaking of king kong its star fay wray has a role in this as does horror icon lionel atwill ill be kind say the acting is okthe vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that its a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isnt personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore its short it tells its story reasonably enough but i must admit im not a fan,negative
lucio fulci was famous for his italian splatter movies mostly his undead films like zombie or the beyond here he directed a black comedy of sorts but theres just one problem its nauseating i say this knowing that i like city of the walking dead which is also gross but not like this a compulsive gambler gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering them and stealing their cash the film makes this plan look that easy i guess the women were too ugly to go to a bank so they always had their cash on person after the upteenth murder i began to suspect what ive always heard about fulci he hated women he must have at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies avoid this film at all costs,negative
this movie was ok as far as movies go it could have been made as a crossover into secular movies however it had little to do with the left behind books that it was supposedly based on major story premises were removed and new major story premises were added what disappointed me most was how nicolae was portrayed he was shown with supernatural powers that he did not have at this point in the books antichrist is not satan is not omniscient and not omnipotent faith and beliefs were portrayed in weird surreal ways that seemed to make the movie just sillynon believers who watch this will have more ammunition to mock christian beliefs,negative
this is probably the worst movie ive seen in a long time independent or not solid writing is a must ditto for directing and acting i know these actors can act ive seen them in sporanos and more but this movie is very bad very bad maybe its the script maybe its the director probably a little of bothprobably a lot of both technically ok just bad bad bad i have a theory that the backers for this movie also own the poker magazines because i saw a very favorable review in one of the magazines hey we made it so its gotta be good right not so fast bucky i know it takes a lot of hard work and money to even get a movie made much less sold and distributed and for that i commend these folks but the final product leave a bad taste in my mouthps i won a free rental and chose this movie from blockbuster tomorrow im going to get my money back,negative
im amazed how many comments on this show are about how real it is maybe im not part of the same universe because if veronica mars is anything its over the top in a big waythe acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through thats not what i call realit is so earnest in its desire to be relevant that it only shows how cut off from reality rob thomas and his staff areoverall i found it to be at best a snooze fest and at worst more than a little annoying kristen bell looks like she could be a good actress but its hard to tell with the over the top style of the whole show,negative
one thing that astonished me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan stoltzfus who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded another reviewer said that von trotta said she never meant for lena to bed goebbels but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the mens release such as the disaster that was stalingrad or the nazis fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protestalso why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in commonoverall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact,negative
if you enjoy riddles and suspense you will enjoy this movie truth be told it was mostly the adrian paul part that got me to pick it up i knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand plot is sarah carly pope a student of philosophy and metaphysics starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles vern adrian paul is a shop owner also a riddle fanatic and also gets entangled in the game myth has it that if you solve the game the meaning of existence referred to as the design is revealed brendan fehrs character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems all in all i thought the movie was pretty well done and its definitely an original concept a rare find these days i personally happen to like riddles and puns so while most of them werent very difficult it was still a fun movie well worth the rental so if you havent seen it get it d,positive

warning spoilers ahead the writers of this story knew these men very well the actors likewise portrayed them very well the result is that by the end of the film you feel like youre actually watching john lennon and paul mccartney the expected tensions are there especially in the awkward first moments but as the two begin to loosen up the old camaraderie that made the beatles work so well begins to show through the bitterness is still there and interrupts at times but by the time john gets the idea to take lorne michaels up on his offer to pay the beatles the gag sum of to appear on saturday night live the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized liverpool together as teens and survived playing the rough nightclubs of hamburg to rise to superstardom but in the end this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently we are reminded why a beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before lennons assassination the two driving forces of the group outgrew each other,positive

there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence one of those few is judy davis who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screenher skills are well displayed in high tide a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong who gave davis her first major success with my brilliant career in that film davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing in high tide however davis character lillie is roughly the opposite she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young and after giving birth to a child runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning when she finally meets up with her daughter years later the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respectgillian armstrongs films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions oscar and lucinda for instance was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each others love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance represented by their gambling addictions here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mothers inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that its too late to change for the better this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center but also a rare achievement a fully convincing story of redemption,positive

out of all the films i could have chosen it had to be this when i was last in new york i went into a times square store and out of the hundreds of dvds they had i chose joel m reeds bloodsucking freaks and this on a double feature dvd that also included seeds of sin did i regret it read on to find out the film opens on an island near milligans staten island home where two lovers are walking along with a massive parasol seemingly made from paper at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift out of nowhere colin hal borske a retarded hunchback pops up and kills both of them for no reason at all after the opening credits which are joined by some of the worst headache inducing music i have ever heard at least it got me used to it as its used constantly throughout the film we are introduced to three couples the wives are all sisters vicky ann linden and ricard fib lablaque veronica eileen hayes and bill don williams plus elizabeth carol vogel and donald richard ramos they each receive a letter from a lawyer h dobbs neil flanagan that request a meeting so he can read their late fathers will dobbs informs them that they must spend three days in their childhood home crenshaw house and fill it with sexual harmony and marital love that it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother he informs the couples that the will is highly irregular but legal after three days the inheritance will be settled the couples are also told about the servants martha veronica radburn hattie maggie rodgers and the retarded colin who welcomes the couples by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them later on that night whats left of the dead rabbit is found in one of the couples beds with a note that says blessed are the meek for they shall inherit this starts a series of events which end in gruesome murder and reveals dark family secretsco written photographed and directed by the talentless andy milligan this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible lets go through just some of its faults the music its awful and headache inducing sound you can barely hear what characters are saying and certain scenes dont have any sound effects plus at certain points you can hear milligan shouting out orders to his actors oh and theres a constant hiss on the soundtrack throughout as well the acting probably among the worst i have ever witnessed the very un special effects colin pokes someones eye out in the opening sequence its the size of a tennis ball the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened up with a saw looks really awful as are the various hands and legs that are chopped off photography milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene he regularly cuts the top bottom or sides of peoples heads and faces off the screen and his camera jerks and shakes around like its operated by someone who is constantly tripping over there is also at least one scene so badly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen the film is often so dark you cant see whats happening too editing again some of the worst ive ever sat through he seems to cut scenes before theyve finished cutting away while characters are in the middle of a sentence the script if there was one credited to both milligan and hal sherwood it took two people to write this is all over the place and is incredibly stupid there is one unbelievably bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down into the basement the killer walks right behind him at one point the potential victim turns around what does the killer do to avoid being spotted they duck down right in from of him the killers close enough to give the guy oral sex yet he doesnt notice them right in front of him you have to see this sequence to believe it i still cant believe what i saw bizarre sub plots just happen and then totally disappear check the scene out when richard has to borrow money from his brother walter producer and co writer hal sherwood who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married a strange scene thats there for no reason at all martha the housekeepers reaction to the first murder shes more bothered by the fact that its thrown her dinner schedule out theres load of insane dialogue as well patty and martha discuss colin patty says if only i didnt beat him so hard martha sympathetically replies you have to patty you have to delivered totally straight faced and dont start me on how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house the only good thing i can think of saying is that the costumes look reasonable for the time period its meant to be set in i could probably go on all day about how amateurish this is but i think you get the idea one to avoid unless your a serious masochist i didnt regret buying or watching it for a second though,negative
robot holocaust is about the lamest most pathetic attempt at making a post apocalyptic movie that ive seen and i thought the italians were the masters of wretched mad max wannabes some of those movies like escape are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo the plot is nonsensical even with a narrator setting up every scene and boy does it drag scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening the special effects and i use the word special loosely consist of sock puppets yes thats right sock puppets the acting is abysmal angelika jager is in the running for worst performance ive ever seen sure shes french or german or whatever but man is she bad i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie so ill stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too manyhowever and fortunately for me i saw the mstk version of robot holocaust some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this mstk episode a winner for a season one episode the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time on my mstk rating scale i give this episode a seek it out,negative
i really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it rita hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous although a musical i thought rita hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well as far as her dancing i think she was excellent even betty grable pretty much endorsed ritas dancing in this film as she commented that rita danced rings around her own dancing and lets face it betty grable was an excellent dancer the cinematography and vivid colors are also noted rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but shes also in love with her mentor played by gene kelly does she leave kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever youll have to watch the film to find out,positive
i must first mention that as a group of mates we often find entertainment in wacthing films which are known to be terrible for comedy value hence our rental of camp bloodcamp blood was the first film which wed rented that had been shot on what looks to be a camcorder and was so rubbish it wanst even funnythe dvd was returned and a refund was demanded with the added suggestion some sort of quality control is implemented to prevent such utter rubbish being stockeddont do what i did and let the curiosity get the better of you its so bad its not even funny,negative
i saw this on the shelves at the rental place and i have rented everything else so i said why not why not is because its one of the worst movies i have ever seen it looks like it was shot with home camcorder i guess thats all the budget would allow there was less boobs in it than i thought there would be some people made it out to be soft porn with a few killings the funniest part of the whole movie to me is in the extra stuff there is a spot with deleted scenes well there is only one but it is the dumbest and i think it may have brought the rest of the movie down the girls get in a hot tub and find some chocolate syrup in the bathroom yes it ends up all over them great stuff this movie is very very bad dont bother,negative
now i know that a lot of black humor pokes fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth but that doesnt mean that they always are funny dont be a menace is an example of this the urban movie certainly lends itself for satire the problem is that wayans and consorts not only try satirize the typical ghetto culture they also belittle valid statements that are made in urban movies such as boyz n the hood or menace ii society personally i think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters besides this the movie in itself is terrible its absolutely not funny the jokes are racist instead of satirizing the urban movie genre the moviemakers show their views of the ignorant urban ghetto blacks now there are some other jokes in this movie but i believe this to be the main farein conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy satire movie they have examples in men with black hats which was made before this movie and friday,negative
this movie is not the scariest of all time but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick low budget no stars lots of inventive death scenes and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats the premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well a nice starting point for just say julie brown exposing her talents early in her career this film wont be seen by many but for fans of s horror its a must,positive
this is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good even though some of the actors and actresses werent very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were one year old it was funny gross and just all out a very good movie in most parts i just didnt know what was going to happen next i was like i think this is going to happen wait i think this is going to happen all age groups will love this movie in some parts i couldnt stop laughing it was so funny but in some parts i was totally grossed out and i couldnt believe what i was seeing i am definitely going to see this movie again it is one of those movies where it cant get boring every time you see it is so suspenseful i definitely recommend seeing this movie,positive
when i think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world texture smell color thats how i think this movie should be judged in terms of see the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle dont just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you,positive

this story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last harem of the ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived therei enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes a few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piecethe main character safiya is played wonderfully by marie gillain who i am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it the scenes with her and alex descas nadir are charming and lovelyi recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating,positive
bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and night of the living dead in specific and is constantly inventive the production values are a little rough at times its a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain hey george romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered dead video tape laserdisc and dvd that should tell you something,positive
what a wonderful fanciful movie stardust isi could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see itat a time when hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets ironically stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long forstardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels it has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of light speed to make it quasi modernstardust is about a man from the town of wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom the only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by david kelly one day a young man from wall named ben barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech he happens upon an enchanted kingdom called stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named una she is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain while the witch is away una seduces ben and sends him on his way ben returns to wall without incident and continues his life but nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect a baby boythe boy named tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man charlie cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another nevertheless the young lady named victoria and played sienna miller goes out once with tristain and he confesses his love to her after they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her he agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wallmeanwhile in the kingdom of stormhold the old king perfectly played by peter otoole is dying he calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne his sons names are primus secondus sextmus and septimus the other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throneanyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and voila that what brings the star to earththe star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named yvaine clare danes and she of course is wearing the charm but little does she know she is now being persuaded by tristain the princes and also an aging witch named lamia michelle pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youthcomplicated yes but it all comes together as the adventure unfoldstristain is the first to find yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to victoria he doesnt recognize the growing bond between he and yvaine his initial interest lie only in returning yvaine to victoria as proof of his love but he must get past the princes and lamia first the princes arent that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other and just as in pirates of the caribbean never has death been so funny but tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesnt know its his mother and a band of flying pirates led by robert denirohis is the most important character in the movie and deniro plays it to a tee he steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter though his role is small in length deniro is extraordinarymichelle pfeiffer is wonderful as lamia a sexy evil witch claire danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed yvaine she makes a perfect damsel jason flemyng adam buston rupert everett and mark strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala blithe spirit and high spiritsmoreover director matthew vaughn whose only other directing experience was layer cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoystardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of will want to see this movie multiple times its that good stardust is what movies are supposed to be perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted in other wordsperfect,positive
i couldnt bear to sit through he entire movie do families like this really exist somewhere there have been many comments describing this family as akin to llbean models and such and i think that that is a great description of how they behavedmore absurdly unbelievable writing acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in high school as pigface who of course has grown into a drop dead gorgeous year harvard educated plastic surgeon but only to do good in the world not for the money and she beds steve carrel on the first date thats when i quit watchingif you can completely suspend your disbelief for two hours then perhaps youll enjoy this sentimental self indulgent waste of time,negative
before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut confessions of a dangerous mind they starred together in this movie george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer along with steven soderbergh which shows that they really believed in this project in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project that is in the same line with movie remakes such as oceans eleven and the italian job but somehow this movie is only halve successful or at least it isnt as good as it could had beenthe movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie the fact that they are being played doesnt change much to this even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying or anything like that at allits of course due to the writing that the characters arent used to their full potential i can only assume that the original italian movie i soliti ignoti works out much better than this movie does the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytellingnevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity its an harmless little caper movie in which you simply shouldnt to worry much about the story in that regard welcome to collinwood is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose wellits a movie that you wont regret watching once youve finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing,positive
i have seen some pretty bad movies and this is right up there no plot to speak of its like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap opera i just wanted to smack that little girl because well lets just say shes real suspicious all the way through the movie the monsters running around wearing some bling was funny i also saw a bit of silent hill in there and i read that this was done by and or stared a finnish metal band lordi so its no wonder that it didnt make much sense it seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more the fx are very good the look of the movie the monsters and even the acting also good but the story and the telling of it just arent there,negative
there is no reason to see this movie a good plot idea is handled very badly in the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense the reason for the killings are not made clear the acting is awful nick stahl obviously needs a better director he was excellent in in the bedroom but here he is terrible amber benson from buffy has to change her character someday even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed even though the movie was minutes which is too short for a good movie but too long for this onethere are no deleted scenes in the dvd which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts to the charactersdont spend the time on this one,negative
i couldnt stand to watch very much of this crap this is your standard junk that certain annoying women love old english era drama with lots of costumes and cliché characters that seem to be plucked from either directly from oliver twist or some other dickens novel this uses the usual clichés from the victorian era certain idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of that culture being so bloody repressed is somehow fascinating and romantic this is sap pure and utter junk and boring as watching grass grow as such it is perfect for women who crave some sort of english countryside snoozer romantic drama in a victorian setting but for this man this movie is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a bunch of drab boring scenes with unoriginal characters speaking in that wretched forced and fake english accent,negative
and obviously i didnt see it but looking at the cast and seeing that doug masters is back from the dead i know now to avoid this like the plague i hate it when hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that theyre not going to catch continuity errors a supposedly dead doug masters returning is a big giant one wont you sayand i cant believe that someone like louis gossett jr would return for something like thatdid jason gedrick really decline this well i hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error i bet if he really turned it down he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second filmill probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel but no way am i going to rent this or buy the dvd,negative
and thats why historic biographic movies are so important to all of us moreover when they are so well done like this onebefore i saw the young victoria i knew a few things about queen victoria but in the end i got much more knowledge about it emily blunt is simply great as victoria who would guess that and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscars personally im cheering for herfor technical issues i am pleased to say that is a very successful production with wonderful art direction set decoration and of course like it was expected to be a terrific periodic costume design the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen but foremost incredible woman and mother bravo out of,positive
so fortunate were we to see this fantastic film at the palm springs international film festival upon entering the theater we were handed a small opinion card that would be used for our personal rating of the film looking at the card i turned to my wife and said how many movies in your life do you think you can rate as superb only about for me but then watching the interaction between peter falk and paul reiser while viewing the spectacular scenery in the films setting of new york state i slowly starting bumping the movie up a category at a time certainly it was good but the totally natural repoire of the actors and an award winning performance by a man who will unfortunately probably be remembered for a raincoat wearing detective rather than this film the movie jumped to the excellent levelby the end of the film there were few dry eyes in the house and my usually stoic and callous heart melted just like the grinchs and i ended up giving this a superbthis picture is a must for anyone who has parents no violence or nudity but some strong language,positive
this is one of the most laughably bad films ive ever seen i cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious perhaps he was connected with making it it doesnt have anything going for it there is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless the music score is three trite notes played ad nauseam the plot must have taken all of five minutes to write the dialogue is what a year old would come up with if asked to do a homework project the only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who grimaces trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times the only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder dont waste your time,negative

the reason i am reviewing this is that the previous review was written by someone who walked out of this film not even half way through unfortunately for him he missed out on a film of tremendous beauty agreed the film was very slow to start in fact the friend i was with fell asleep brieflyi woke him before his snoring disturbed the rest of the audience thankfully the film developed from there into a story of love drugs and what it was like to be young and free in the experimental s fantastic performances from the two leads and a great look to the film that gave it a real authentic feel be patient like many great films its well worth the wait and is certainly a film that i will look forward to revisiting,positive

this movies basic premise is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay except for that person and that a man who likes show tunes has good taste and is neat in appearance must be a homosexual yes the movie is funny in parts but the basic premise is to homophobic and insulting that the entire movie crumbles into something that is quite painful to sit through the performances particularly joan cusak and kevin kline are very good,negative
another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craftso many clichés came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments,positive
i like a lot of the actors actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers in or years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early s i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riots and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana nwa public enemy soundgarden etc the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the s and i gurantee you nbc will do it see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you arent thinking i am living in the s or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project,negative
the movie was a pleasure to watch if you are a fan of the stooges the story is told from the point of view of moe howard and his relationships with his brothers shemp and jerome curly howard also the life long friendship with larry fine the movie deals mostly with the off camera high points and pit falls of the stooges multi decade career the casting director and makeup artist did a fair job of finding actors who resembled the famous ensemble the actor who plays curly howard did a fine job of portraying the on camera antics of the most beloved stooge a must see for any fan of three stooges shorts,negative

it is high time that american critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned sloppy veneration of films like sergio leones once upon a time in america the checkered history of this opulent film and the grand fanciful myth associated with its production and many versions belies its mediocrity on a narrative level the film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets the minutia of production detail and the by cliched but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience the plots time frame is confusing gimmicky and laboured leading some critics to imagine the noodles figures opium binging to be the antecedent of some future dream reality as well as the sepia toned remembrances this ham handed overly fan boy apologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display even at this full running time figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness the deborah character is fleetingly established in child form a cold and unattainable trophy female not even hinting at the gravity with which she will re establish her relationship with a post prison noodles the said re union henceforth rings completely false the deadening pace is somewhat to blame certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long signifying very little hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof the trajectory of the figures lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of americas teens through prohibition and its spoils ending with the arguable ruin of its moribund central figures save deborah a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders this notion is commonplace even banal the cast of characters as imagined in the one note script written by seven italians no less are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors who at least venture a few variant facial expressions this is understandable given the almost unworkable material some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably self absorbed but actively seek their own goals assuming the compliance of others eg when noodles gets out of prison max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming noodles will comply this explanation of their abrupt abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense although ennio morricones score is much revered it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves many violent just do not warrant at points it is questionable whether or not morricone was watching the same film i was so incongruous is his work as a paean to american filmmaking it succeeds in terms of mood helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods and visuals not helped by said score but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity,negative
i was surprised when i saw this film id heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel how disappointed i washow any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes the scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times but also ruin the feel of the period as for the cast gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine but then any hot american star would be questionable in the role toni collette is miscast and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughablei really could not say a good thing about this film i seem to be among the very few who dont rate it but if you want my advice see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale believe me that is far preferable to this superficial trash,negative
id like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan with a few notable exceptions and i generally have a low opinion of so called otakus as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky haired big eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors such as the plot and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash fatal fury the motion picture as seen through the glassy witless eyes of an otaku theres little to find fault with in fatal fury theres plenty of quirky japanese y humor one on one duels some dramatic moments and everything is beautifully drawn but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched predictable plot with cliched predictable characters culminating in a cliched predictable ending the love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which sulia heals terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment but its virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it and of course fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon ta this is supplied gratuitously by the huge breasted mai shiranui and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name oh boy were treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle in which all the main characters engage the all powerful main villain in one on one combat in turn thats some thing thats always amused me even when battles in animes arent taking place in a tournament they always happen as if they were regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury so would fatal fury have been good if it wasnt an anime the answer is an emphatic no all of this movies charm what little of it there is resides in the actual drawings had fatal fury not been an anime it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater if the show was still on the air thats the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad b movie in the guise of an anime epic if youre a fan of movies so bad that theyre actually entertaining consider renting fatal fury or catch it on the sci fi channel as it is definitely one of those if youre an otaku please wake up and realize that a good of the stuff youre watching is garbage as for everyone else buy a dreamcast and fatal fury mark of the wolves but dont even consider seeing this movie,negative

scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and companyshaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalim not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous scooby showsand the animation style is very bizarre and distorted i like it but its not real scooby doo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might tooits worth a glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides i am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes well see how it looks after two more episodes by then ill have formed a much more solid opinion,negative

ordinarily anthony mann made westerns with the big guys james stewart gary cooper henry fonda the a list cowboy stars but in this b film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western the main character played by victor mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films robert redford in jeremiah johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men not here for once a true mountain man vulgar crude animalistic is the central figure and its something to see giving mature one of his better later roles the real acting chops are provided by robert preston excellent as a self absorbed custer type cavalry commander and james whitmore the poor mans spencer tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format good show and underrated movie all around,positive
i truly despised this film when i saw it at the age of about or as i was a huge fan of robin williams and nothing he could do was bad until this this complete trash ruined robin for me for a long time im only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake bicenntinial man i think it was called but the point is robin should be getting much better jobs by now and now he has returned to performing the slime that originated with this classic,negative
this was absolutely one of the best movies ive seen excellent performances from a marvelous a list cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and backi couldnt help but care about the characters ms merkerson will blow you away as will the young man playing the young leadi also thought that the set design was top rate the viewer is really placed inside each era as its presented the music is a blast too nice selections to represent mood time and place the blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs this is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings take the time to watch it,positive

the journey is a very good film produced in the spring of in vienna and released in this movie was quite popular in his early years despite the political problems which influenced the movies success because the story happens during the hungarian revolution the cold war the journey is a very good film but not well known i think it should be released immediately on dvd because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home one of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between deborah kerr and yul brynner their intense relationship all their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the great passion and love between the characters major surov and diana ashmore another quality is the script which is very well written it was even published as a novel by the screen player george tabori the film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end at first we didnt know if diana and the other travelers could leave hungary because the communist major discovers that dianas friend paul kedes is hungarian and he isnt allowed to leave the country the major falls deeply in love with diana and this is in fact the true reason why he doesnt want to let her go but after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen and she kisses him too he lets her go and the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed the major and diana say goodbye she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers including paul while surov is shot several times by some hungarians so he dies yul brynner is very very handsome and deborah kerr is very beautiful charming refined just like an english lady yul and deborah are perfect together they are one of the greatest couples of the golden hollywood a true moviegoer should watch this film the journey has everything that a good film should have a great captivating story interesting characters a wonderful direction anatole litvak is in my opinion at his best finally i want to give a message to warner bros studios or those who restore and release classic films please release the journey on dvd as soon as possible,positive
i wont say the show is all bad because there are some funny parts like spencer and a few random incidents but other than that lets face it its just another dry sitcom that kids are buying intomiranda cosgrove was cute and funny as megan on drake and josh honestly she is mediocre in icarly and is just not as funny as she tries to be the actress who plays sam seems to be half asleep most of the time and her antics are so clichéd that i would think of them theyre not funny just annoying and freddie is okay but not that interestingof course the situations are unrealistic but its not all bad some are bothersome though here are a few the girls are and have a web show that gives away too much personal information with a weekly audience of wtf with little to no advertising and they can still go on about their lives not being attacked by crazy people their web show gets too much praise yearly to advertise sneakers a free trip to japan plain white ts performance and so on honestly anyone over the age of would not find their comedy entertaining how is it that they are so average yet they own a three story loft spencer does hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxuries and they have all the equipment for a web show all of the adults are idiots all of them no foot high girl no matter how obnoxious and tenacious can take down trained cops unless shes muscular sam is skinny and petite no one can fall down stories in an elevator and live kids can handle finding out about criminals better than copsthe show is stupid really it seems harmless but making kids think that they can be obnoxious to their elders live alone in seattle when theyre only with an irresponsible moron and give out personal information is just wrongim disappointed to say that my cousin who is enjoys the show what happened to the cartoons when i was her age,negative

miscasting happens susannah yorke is a luminous young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an arthritic janes deceased uncle is in better shape he creaks and snarls obnoxious and grim he looks like an ax murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened were not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic the great love story looks like a sado masochistic nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but brontes rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he unsuccessfully attempts to stifle,negative
this is one of my most favorite movies of all time pretty pathetic you say well yeah it is but chris is incredibly incredibly funny his innocent brilliance comes out in this film more than in any of his other films look at both motel scenes when spade gets caught with his zipper down and the other just go away for the love of god,positive
so this is the worst movie you will probably ever see its up there with crossbones and southern comfort but if your a bad movie fan like i am this atrocity of a film will be the most fun youve had in years why does the camera make old school kung fu noises when it zooms why does that random guy stuff a nascar commemorative plate in his bag and who is he anyway why do the vampires shoot lightning after they die what is this highlander dracula mccloud who cares just laugh at it this movie has no continuity no plot no anything really ron halls range of emotions are always off he looks happy when he should be sad angry when he should be confused the rest of the cast couldnt act their way out of a paper bag the special short bus kinda special effects are randomly placed and never needed most scenes are lit with a desk lamp if they are lit at all mel novak has the audacity to look off camera for his line and its not even edited out they just keep on filming in fact half of this movie isnt even on film at all its film sony hand cam for most of the film it seems that they left their boom mike at home this movie doesnt just have a few plot holes its a mine field of confusion and mental pain but oh do i love it thank you ron hall for this cinematic abomination i went out and bought it cause its just so damn funny on amazon and i had it rush deliveredi have weapons i have weapons i have weapons,negative
theyre not jawing journalists cary grant and rosalind russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in scoop their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post depression allens writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great splendini magician responds about his background i was born into the hebrew persuasion but when i got older i converted to narcissism johansson fresh from allens match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a reworking of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun boating accident as a matter of fact allen is reworking manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of cairo to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he reworks i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatnessallen as director and actor cant hide his love for the actress as he couldnt for diane keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen quips id be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards scoop with music from grieg tchaikovsky and strauss to let us know the woodman has not lost his touch of class,positive
let me state this right from the start i do not hate this show i actually quite like some aspects of it in fact when i first started to watch it i quickly became hooked i was just starting to come out of the whole anime is for kids stereotype and the mature elements of the show had me intriguedunfortunately after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films i can say that my overall disposition has changed and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague bad anime seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on tv by the end only one friend and i were still watching and neither of us liked itallow me to explain the plot for you you can skip this paragraph if you dont want to know kagome is an average high school student who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine when kagome comes out of the well again she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan she meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge justice groping in one characters case overall they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use itwhile there are many many side stories and story arcs there is no were near enough material to occupy episodes the only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull the band of seven after the half way mark in the series or maybe even before it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes these episodes have little to no impact on the story and rarely even on the characters in some cases some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it inuyasha shoots wind scar at enemy windscar deflects characters gasp in horror enemy turns out to have barrier characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust also major spoiler the conclusion will be revealed the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted hours major spoiler overthe animation itself is above average and in some cases excellent even so reused animation cells plague most action scenes and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a rowon the brighter side however all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating also the character designs appearences were brilliant and at times among the best i have seen particularly with the band of seven there is definitely no shortage of cosplay opportunities here even so i found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot and some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again one particular joke sit boy is found within the first five episodes and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining episodesalthough there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over sesshomiru and inuyashabottom line definitely worth checking out but not worth watching the whole series the first episodes are very clever original and enjoyable for anybody but after that it simply becomes dull and tedious watching a tv show should never feel like a chore but somehow this series accomplishes just that dont expect much from inuyasha because you will only feel let down,negative
where the sidewalk ends where one ends another beginsthis is a prototypical film noir and as such pretty flawless from both style and content points of view the photography and night settings are first rate cinematographer joseph lashelle lets the drama ooze in scene after scene and the close ups on faces pure expressionism i can watch this kind of film for the visuals alone even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks but the acting is first rate here and the plot features what i consider the core of most noir films the alienated male lead representing the many men returning home to a changed united states after the war and feeling lost themselves in fact not only is dana andrews really convincing as the troubled loner detective he has a small but important counterpart in the film the lead females first husband an decorated ex gi fallen onto hard times and booze the fact the one man kills the other might be of monumental significance overall the regular guy struggling through his inner problems to success while the medal wearing soldier slips into an accidental death with a silver plate in his head the woman transitions from one to the other we assume they marry and have children as suggested earlier in the movie even if this is pushing an interpretation onto it after the fact we can still see the path of one man with some psychological baggage careening through a crisis to the highest kind of moral order turning himself in for a small crime just at the point he has actually gotten away with itthis movie belongs to andrews he plays a far more restrained and moving type than kirk douglas plays in a similar role in william wylers detective story made just one year later and andrews certainly is less theatrical you could easily see both movies side by side for a textbook compare and contrast session the fact that andrews as detective dixon is morally struggling through it all and douglas as detective mcleod is not might explain why one man gets his girl and the other doesnt gene tierney pulls off a hugely sympathetic demurring and ultimately conventional and pretty type of woman not just a cardboard desirable but someone you want dixon to actually marry the criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama but is effective enough in its play with types and clichés the bit parts are kept snappy the small details like the portable craps table nice touches far from the character actors or the glamour of gambling in casablanca but then curtizs great movie is iconic even in the details it makes no effort to be subtle and real and penetrating but instead is sweeping and memorable and inspiring they come at opposite ends of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men bogart is beginning his active duty dixon and the man dixon has killed are all through through thoroughly but not washed upits no accident that many possibly most film noirs have what you would call happy endings the man overcomes his adversaries and transforms his inner self and the moviegoer then and now understands just how beautiful that must feel,positive

a boring movie about a miserable loserthats factotum in a nutshell matt dillon plays henry chinaski alter ego of author charles bukowski upon whose novel the film is based as we meet chinaski he may be a writer but hes certainly not a successful one he floats through life getting fired from one menial job after another and not caring a bit the fact that hes always drunk may have something to do with his not caring he meets a woman jan played by lili taylor and a relationship ensues chinaski moves into jans apartment and now instead of getting drunk by himself he can get drunk with somebody else good times eventually hes had enough of this relationship so chinaski strikes out on his own unfortunately he still cant hold down a job so soon enough hes broke at this point marisa tomei shows up and for some reason her character laura decides to rescue this miserable drunken loser whom she doesnt even know we soon meet some of lauras acquaintances and the film veers off into a sort of bizarro world with this rather eclectic bunch soon enough tomei and friends are out of the picture and once again were left with chinaski and his drinking and his miserable little life theres some more time spent with jan but mostly theres just time spent being a drunk unemployable loser and then the movies over and not a moment too soon minutes of absolute monotony and it seems infinitely longer as the movie drags on nothing happens nothing ever happens if you want to spend an hour and a half of your life watching matt dillon drink then this is the movie for you if youre looking for a compelling story well developed characters or any entertainment value whatsoever then youve come to the wrong place dillons performance actually isnt bad at all too bad the movie which surrounds him is in fact rather bad,negative

high school years and decades later some look back on it with fondness others with embarrassment but few find it easy to forget its one of the most critical phases of our lives when changes come fast and furious whether were ready or not no longer children not yet adults irresistible forces buffet us pushing and pulling us in every directionfame did its best to capture this turbulent chaotic period for its cast of young characters for the most part it succeeded it meandered but did feel like a slice of life this movie holds a special place in the hearts of the class of we had just bid farewell to a decade and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years we were headed out into the cold cruel world leaving home for college then parts unknown as we approached our watershed event this newly released movie was like a two hour yearbook for us we couldnt escape the titular song on the radio that was us up there on the screen those were our friends rivals and classmates as we had faced our own dreams frustrations successes and failuresits especially poignant for those who attended any of new york citys other elite top tier high schools especially stuyvesant bronx hs of science or brooklyn tech like the kids here we were considered the best of the best we had no auditions but instead rigorous entrance exams perhaps even more than the performing arts kids we were expected to change the world although not necessarily become famous like them not all of us made it but the pressure cooker environment fostered extraordinary camaraderie and esprit de corps not unlike the toe tapping hot lunch jam in the cafeteria on our own graduation day our spirits soared almost like the jubilant crescendo in the rousing finale the film leaves us fittingly on a single triumphant note at the end of i sing the body electric pointing to the blindingly bright boundless future and all the promise it heldfame couldnt have been set anywhere else this story never would have worked in a small or suburban school los angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television but nyc is a mecca for all of the arts home not only to what was then called pa but also world renowned juilliard nyc is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world its also a time capsule of the rest of the city of the time showing the seediness grit and dirt that was endemic of a new york still struggling back from the fiscal crisis that had nearly bankrupted it but most of all it showed the vitality since muted by the inroads of giuliani disney and tourismwhat i wouldnt give to be young again but with fame at least i can remember what it was like,positive

question how does a film merit two different titles like the librarians and strike force answer the film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldnt even decide on a title this film is a hodgepodge of martial arts death wish vendettas melodrama romance and other cliché film techniques the story focuses on a vigilante group called the librarians led by agent simon william forsythe the group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious multi lingual pockmarked creature named marcos andrew divoff who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south florida burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls i have ever heard this may have been burts attempt at an irish dialect but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in the godfather also appearing in this film is erika eleniak who has infiltrated the inner circle of marcos bizarre world erikas character kick boxes her way into an alliance with simon the librarians and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv converter box,negative

a very credible and unsettling movie portraying the effects of war on the general public shame gives us a chilling understanding oh ingmar bergmans beliefs the absence of color and sound as in a soundtrack helps to give the film a more realistic feeling there is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a charming or dramatic effect everything is very simply portrayed as it would be in reality at times the storyline was confusing but perhaps in order to give a sense of the characters frame of mind how they too do now know what is happening or why the simplicity of the film made it somewhat boring but i could understand how the director is trying not to glamorize the story and points he depicted the harsh and unsettling events and effects of war in the beginning the characters were introduced and shown as content with the lighter settings and very long drawn out shots when all of a sudden the war struck upon them they were much darker and quiet with less intimate shots bergman did a good job on allowing us to be consumed by the war ourselves and presenting an image of it the so adequately corresponded to war although the storyline itself was not too impressive the content of the film was,positive

exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a euro trash sexy horror flick i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out all the good stuff more than likely i got the pg addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new planet of the apes movie watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff youll need it,negative
first of all no one with any law enforcement experience not er or emt but real law enforcement takes this show seriously walker would be drummed out of any police force in the us for his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics on top of that he is a comic book character no acting ability incredibly trite lines no character development the fact that alex cahill loves him shows just how dumb blondes really are and trivett is the ultimate clown in black face come on if you think walker is a heartfelt show without bias then explain why jt is treated as a dolt always is the subject of walkers jokes never is allowed to be the one to solve the crime and never rescues walker who should be dead times over for the stupid things he does while it may be true that many criminals are even dumber than the detectives who go after them and believe me most cops are dumber than dirt the smart ones walker comes up against never seem to get the point that once walker is captured the jerk needs to be put of his misery but then again norris produced the show as well as starred in it so how could he willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are as if six guys are going to wait around to take him one at a time what a terrible series it is more demeaning than any of the hokey westerns like the lone ranger roy rogers the cisco kid and wild bill hickock though i would imagine that most of you on here are far too young to remember those shows but like those shows in the same way as those shows walker tr is just as insulting and just plain silly,negative
ive no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money nowyeah this is a plausible story if you regard the alien abduction sequence in life of brian as plausiblethis film is little more than a leftist pipedream had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons the result wouldve been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war bad as korea vietnam and other wars of the era were they were proxy wars fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagementthis film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation as if someone would say mr president some kids at drastic high are not eating and ronald reagan would reply my god id better revise my defense policy rightlike this film wouldnt it be better if the soviet union wouldve collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build wait that happened,negative
it seems the makers of this film had trouble deciding what their message really was consequently they had even more trouble delivering it they began by poorly describing principles of quantum physics which relate to sub atomic particles having established a fuzzy picture of heisenbergs uncertainty principle they presented a barrage of talking heads who built a case of ridiculous logic intimating that every living person is an entity which follows the same quantum rules on a cosmic scale then there was a lot of talk about ideas upon which stephen covey and tony robbins have made their careers positive thinking interrupting bad patterns always look on the bright side etc next came a bit about how our brains can change our bodies through production of proteins hormones which we more or less choose to create if you are sad you will create sad proteins if you are happy you will create happy proteins its just so simple isnt it interwoven with our lessons we follow the fictitious life of amanda a photographer who pops anti depressants and hates her thighs the film makers slowly but surely were trying to get us all to say hey amanda just cheer up why cant she cheer up obviously its because the world is a bad place where there is crime and poverty and religion thats why the conclusion of the film which is basically the entire second half brought on a barrage of contradiction we are all a part of a whole energy where we are not beings but a collective consciousness but we are individuals who can change the world but there are many of each of us because of all the different dimensions but we can choose who we are and we have a purpose to do good but there is no god because there is nothing better than us so there is no such thing as right and wrong so there is no such thing as reward or punishment so nothing good ever came out of religion but we should still do good anyway even though there is no such thing as bad and good because there is nobody to decide what that is except for the fact that we each can make life good if we all meditate and then crime will cease and if we say nice things our water will freeze into pretty shapes still with me good because there is more according to robert l park in his book voodoo science the whole meditation experiment put on by john hagelin in washington dc was a farce the numbers were doctored and the murder rate was higher that year that any year before or since and what about your positive attitude keeping you young and healthy this was a message delivered by an older man who looked his age and a woman who was overweightso does all this work or not i was lucky enough to see the film at a theater where betsy chasse one of the films three directors yes three fielded questions following the show i call myself lucky because i had first hand confirmation that these people dont know what they are talking about several of the questions asked by audience members had her so stumped that her husband a chiropractor had to step in and recite the answer i finally had to leave when the discussion inevitably turned political and everyone including ms chasse began speculating as to how wonderful the world would be if only president bush could see this movie,negative
so i rented this movie hoping to learn about the democratic republic of congo drc and the beginnings of its independence from belgian rule i was excited to become familiar with the figures involved in its history mainly lumumba and mobutu i wanted to see how the new congolese government attempted to bring together the various groups opposing colonial rule the political motives behind each one the reasons behind belgiums decision to give the drc its independence and also how the united states and the former ussr were involved sadly all of my questions went largely unanswered my belief is that this movie was made by people who through a passing familiarity with the story of the drcs fight for freedom saw a story filled with drama and emotion and decided to exploit it they then proceeded to try and stuff all the dramatic points into a storyline briefly filled them out with dialogue went to the set and shot it i could be wrong but if so its all the sadder because then the makers must have simply become too tied up in getting everything in and ended up glossing over all details in an effort to create an encompassing history whatever the reason the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentence long statements and facts printed on the screen the film goes through each major occurrence and tells the viewer point blank the main idea of whats going on completely smoothing over the actual details in favor of getting across the big things for instance there is the scene when lumumba is captured by the increasingly rebellious army controlled by mobutu in the situation the soldiers have three possible viewpoints one that sympathizes with lumumba one that vilifies lumumba and one that stands in the middle sympathizing and yet obeying orders correspondingly there are three soldiers that speak in the scene uttering lines that unadornedly show their points of view then to avoid dealing with the actual tensions that these opposing viewpoints bring up the scriptwriters simply inserted some random shooting more army guys show up and they just end up beating everyone up this is the extent of the reflectiveness of the movie most of the time each character simply states their basic motives the other characters respond with theirs and thats that theres little telling through actions even the things they say are direct the point of painfulness its hard to believe that the people represented actually acted like that also in the trend of this directness things like political tension between factions is reduced to simple acknowledgement of the fact we never learn what these factions are what theyre fighting for their power basically anything except that they exist the characters likewise are one dimensional and flat unfortunately i dont know whether lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to ideals of congolese unity but after an hour or so of the movie i certainly didnt trust it to tell me so the drc like many developing countries has a complicated and important history especially in the period leading up to and after independence but the telling of these histories will not be useful unless there is recognition of the intricacy of the situations lumumba fails to give proper attention to these details and ends up telling the viewer little except the most general of outlines,negative
this was one of the dullest movies i have seen in some time im in my late s and watched it with my son in law early s and son the scenery was beautiful but the story was a bust we watched about an hour of it and turned it off i spent more time on my iphone during the hour that we watched it than i spent actually watching the movie i gave it a because i enjoyed the scenery and cinematography otherwise i would have given it a im sure there are people who are really into the art of it all who will find my review appalling but were all entitled to our own opinions right i couldnt figure out if this was supposed to be a chick flick where the focus was on the mother or if it was supposed to be a movie for guys with the focus on battle and adventure in my opinion it didnt succeed in either,negative
in a minute to pray a second to die clay mccord alex cord is an unhappy outlaw with a ten thousand dollar bounty on his head and degenerative epilepsyrealizing his days as an outlaw are numbered he wants desperately though somewhat reluctantly to take advantage of an amnesty being granted by rough and tumble territorial governor robert ryan excellent performance who badly wants mccord to renounce his ways and accept the amnesty as an example to others while in the bandit hub of escondito outlaw mario brega plans to kill mccord to stop that from happeningalso starring arthur kennedy aldo sambrell and a slew of other familiar european faces this is co written and produced by american spaghetti western pioneer albert band also responsible for the pre leone film gunfight at red sandsthough the solution to the main characters epilepsy is lifted straight out of howard hawks el dorado the script is solid pretty fresh and unpretentious this has a great balance of action and story and alex cord is great in it he really should have been a bigger starin defense of the shorter well dubbed english version personally im past that age where the longer version is always the better version and the ending where mccord is ironically gunned down by grimy bounty hunters after his pardon is needlessly nihilistic and completely destroys the films message about hope and redemptioncall me old fashioned but i rooted for mccord and felt he earned that happy ending,positive
this movie was amazing it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director writer sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good cheadle did a great job too this movie is great for a mature intelligent audience the acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the writing and directing of the film this film focuses on the real americans the past generation no stereotypes or racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life this film is about loss and coping instead of picking on psychiatry it defines it not as someone who heals you magically but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you but rather will guide you though your thoughts this movie is all round amazing,positive
based on the true story of two young americans who sold national secrets to the soviet union in the height of the cold war falcon and the snowman wants to be both suspenseful and philosophical and winds up falling short in both departments its less le carré than who carestimothy hutton stars as christopher boyce a former seminarian who disgusted by watergate and the middle class values around him is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites for the cia sean penn plays his drug dealing pal daulton lee who makes himself boyces courier delivering secret files to the soviet embassy in mexico city an offbeat synth jazz score lack of sympathy or emotional attachment for anyone and lots of scenes of guys getting angry in rooms all combine to deaden what could have a decent moral dilemma thrillerits really penns movie despite the second billing his character gets to talk turkey with the russians while hutton plays with his pet falcon hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before they called action with penn its a crapshoot whether you get a brilliant performance or an over the top one here its a bit of both but more the latter especially in the second half when lee switches from coke to heroin he screeches he snorts he crashes russian embassy parties he gets pummeled with telephone books he spits at himself in a mirror a big goober he must have been saving for a paparazzi i dont know who my friends are anymore he cries out its exhausting to just watch himpenn seems to have modeled lee somewhat on dustin hoffmans ratso rizzo from midnight cowboy complete with overly nasal line readings and constant eye shifting john schlesinger directed this film as well as midnight cowboy but he seems to have had another hoffman film in mind the graduate throwing up scene after scene of boyce and lee poolside trying to decide how to live their lives in their gilded cage too bad no one suggested plasticsfrom the opening shots news footage of american decline juxtaposed with boyce and his bird falcon makes clear it is a message movie though the message itself is far from clear probably because the characters never come into focus is boyce supposed to be an idealist or is he just a mercenary hutton and schlesinger dont seem to know which makes it harder for us meanwhile opportunities to establish some suspense like boyce stealing documents from the top secret black vault where he works or lee playing games with the russians are interrupted by jump cuts to scenes of the pair with their families and friends its the normalcy of the story that schlesinger finds interesting but its the least interesting aspect for usgood stuff its interesting to see a film that works the s vibe so early as this one referencing maria muldaur and tang dorian harewood memorable in full metal jacket has a nice turn as boyces paranoid colleague gene who shows boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder but has some serious nam issues beneath his partying exterior macon mccalman is also fine in a totally different way as the no nonsense boss who gives boyce his high security job david suchet as the russian embassy official who deals with lee makes for a fascinating blend of menace and amiabilitybut falcon and the snowman stands or falls on the the question of the two title characters and neither the actors nor schlesinger are able to mine much in the way of answers worse after more than two hours in their alternately feral and catatonic company you dont really want answers you just want those credits to roll,negative
this along with hare tonic ranks as one of the best bugs cartoons indeed one of the best bugs ever there are some comments about how bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning i guess that he is as yet not fully developed i actually prefer this basic version from the mid s chuck jones was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over yosemite sam and daffy duck the latter day bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking also check out hair raising hare and rabbit punch for great examples of classic bugs and classic chuck jones,positive
theres nothing to say except i want my time back that this movie took from me im not racist against latinos hell im half brazilian i loved the movie kids it doesnt make any sense these kids just go around and do nothing theyre not even good at skating the whole time im just waiting for something anything to happen but it doesnt nothing happens the whole movie did i mention they suck at skating i might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sht out of poser moron punks like these kids im not even going to get into it this movie sucks please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul wont make the same mistake,negative
the plot of this movie is dangerously thin and the only star power if we can call it that consists of joe estevez i dont know what is more shocking the fact that this movie was made or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it if you ever see the cover of the video youll be able to read them someone even went as far as saying that the actress writer could be the leading lady of the s yeah and joe estevez could have more money than his brother martin if you want to check it out anyways i highly recommend watching the mts version of it at least youll laugh a lot without going insane,negative
lou gossett jr is an excellent and captivating actor but to have him take the role of a president and then have him act like hes james bond running around carrying a gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill christians and then being able to escape the supposedly high security facility to live another day does not do him justice this movie has so many unresolved issuesi will attempt to list just a few what was the purpose of stockpiling a vaccine if no one is vaccinated for example the preacher could have been vaccinated if the tribulation force already had vaccine on hand later buck williams wife goes to be with the sick preacher and she herself becomes sick so was the virus therefore contagious if it was contagious then why did ray and his wife go into the church without proper protection why didnt they become sick too and when chloe drank the wine and was cured how did she suddenly know the wine was the antidote was it california wine ordinary red table wine could red grape juice been adequate andif the preacher had received communion at least every time he preached maybe he would have had anti dote flowing through his body already buck and chloe got a heavy box of vaccine that was never used what mysterious message should we see in that the presentation of evil forces who are working with the anti christ nicolai to destroy the world as being russian chinese etc is really a relic of the s and the early james bond era and shows an ignorance of modern society and of humanity are we to believe that russians and chinese are perpetually trying to destroy this planet and for what purpose mere destruction this was such a narrow minded view of this world and was so cliché as to be laughable the main purpose of this movie was the scene near the very end where kirk cameron and lou gossett jr are proselytizing the non believers in the audience by showing kirk proselytizing lou it was a movie with no meaningful storyline too many disconnects with reality and a completely inappropriate plot for a great actori therefore rank this as a since zero is not available,negative
through the years ive been very much interested in the life of this teenager who left such a profound indelible mark on the world my fascination has also been born of fear as in could this happen againand throughout the ensuing years yes i fear it continues to happen around us and of course it was happening long before anne the it of course is can a so called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent country race continent and murder citizens in cold blood on the flimsiest of excuses i leave that question out thereat the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about the leader adolf hitler in that the one profound fact about hitler that is never mentioned was that he was elected democratically and all of the atrocities committed were done as the result of a compliant poodle press and fear mongering propaganda played over and over again for a docile populationone of the atrocities was anne frank who put a face to the death camps by the miracle of her diarys survivalkenneth brannagh does a wonderful job on the commentary and interviewing he has that rare gift of minimizing his own persona thus allowing the subjects to speak for themselvesmany new facts and people never before interviewed are brought to life in the meticulous research which i will not go into here as they add immeasurably to the reality and gut wrenching sorrow of the filmglenn close reads selections from the diary and her voice is perfect for the part she brings a naiveté and freshness to the roleold childhood friends of annes are interviewed at length and her last days before death are well recorded and witnessed along with her vibrant and mischievous personalitythis is not to be missed a wonderful and respectful film about the seldom seen anne out of,positive
ive got to say it gary busey saved this film if it were not for his fine acting talents this film would have been sub par i recommend the film but just barelythe biggest difficulty with the film is its broad disregard for historical geographical and physical accuracy for example why is lubbock green and hilly how come buddys producer petty ignored where are the daily trips to the clovis new mexico studio why is nashville treated as a racist hate camp out to destroy the holly sound why was buddys two week courtship to maria treated as a complex taboo race mixing stereotype why are buddys tile boxes as light as feathers finally why are the crickets portrayed as trouble making roadblocks to hollys talenttaken on their face these inaccuracies should spell doom for any film proclaiming itself the buddy holly story however busey does deliver a stirring portrayal as the man whose death eventually led to the day the music died,positive
this movie is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it ever got made for example they get into the sewers from the capitol and while theyre in the sewers you can see signs pointing to various government buildings and then they come up in the middle of the street i highly doubt that government buildings would provide public access through the city sewer system anyways i gave this a instead of a just because of its comic value i laughed the whole way through at the idiocy of everyone involved in this movie,negative
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a whats up tiger lily with this filmit has to be one of the worst french films ive seen in a long time actually along with brotherwood of the wolves horrendous films in a much too short period of timeits really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor filmlou doyon is quite bad as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they dont necessarily give you talentavoid this film if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de dartagnan,negative
i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didnt pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants,negative
first off i really enjoyed zombi by lucio fulci this film was utter trash i couldnt stand to watch it the storyline was a joke the acting was a joke and the fact that zombi has nothing to do with zombi is even more a jokewe jump from voodoo to death the harmful agent brining people back to life whatever this movie isnt worth the it cost to rent it i really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible if zombi is an indicator for how zombi and are going to be i think i will just skip themzombi is an awesome flique tho,negative
i think its a great movie because you get to see how dianas life at home is she got so much aggression and she wants to prove that girls can fight too i think she and adrian were great actors because of this movie i am boxing too it really impressed me the only negative part i think is the end because its alright between diana and adrian but you dont get to see how it is at home and i didnt really like it that you also dont get to see how her father is doing and her brother but i think it was a great movie and i think im going to watch it a lot more i recommend it to anyone even when you dont like boxing you get to see a lot more than only boxing i had a great time watching it,positive

kramer vs kramer is the story of a marital breakup and the consequences of same they can be devastating to the partners and even more so to a minor child which in this case is played by justin henrywhat i really did like about kramer vs kramer its greatest strength as a film is the way that parents dustin hoffman and meryl streep are presented to the audience as whole people with many sides to their nature though the film is slanted in hoffmans direction and more about his relationship with his son hes not presented as any kind of saint nor is streep a completely black villain hoffmans a career oriented man in the advertising game hes pretty much ignored his wifes dreams and aspirations still its a big shock to him when streep says the loves no longer there and she wants out she also wants out of being a mother at least for a whilehoffman and henry make do the best they can the pressure of being both parents causes hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying one in another agency at that point after over a year streep decides she wants custodyboth parents make compelling witnesses and state their case beautifully but in these situations the tie is always broken in favor of the motherdustin hoffman and meryl streep won their first of two oscars respectively for this film her in the supporting actress category im not sure how these things are decided streep does get less screen time than hoffman if thats the determining factor the film does focus on hoffmans relationship with his son and his evolving realization that he has his share of the blame for the marriage failure as for meryl its a hobs choice for her as it is for many women to balance a career and motherhood the conflict in her psyche registers for all to see on the screendustin hoffman may have won that oscar partly for the same reason that spencer tracy picked up his first by performing the impossible task of not letting a scene stealing child steal the film children with their lack of inhibitions are natural actors and henry is great because he comes over as a real kid not a hollywood kid i wonder if hoffman saw captains courageous and saw how spencer tracy dealt with freddie bartholomew dustin could have done a lot worse than channel spencer tracy in his performancekramer vs kramer also won oscars for best picture best director for robert benton and best adapted screenplay its an intelligent and compelling drama about adults falling out of love and trying to deal as best they can with it for themselves and their child dont miss it if ever broadcast,positive
telly savalas put on a passable but no better than that performance as pancho villa the notorious mexican bandit revolutionary in this account of villas raid on the town of columbus new mexico in villa is not really a historical figure who im overly familiar with so i wont say much about the historical details of the film as a movie this isnt great although it has a smattering here and there of both action and humour chuck connors performance as colonel wilcox commander of the us army base near columbus struck me as a bit over the top and clint walker as villas gringo sidekick scotty didnt really do very much for me the movie is obviously a pretty low budget effort of limited technical quality for a movie with a runtime of only slightly over an hour and a half i have to say that this movie dragged in places particularly in the last minutes or so villas raid into the united states was an interesting if in the overall scheme of things not especially important historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this,negative
perhaps i couldnt find the dvd menu selection for plot on off clearly the default is off when the end credits began to roll i couldnt believe that was it like our poor but beautiful protagonist i felt used dirty cheapthe characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writers disdain for wealthy thatcherites was all to apparent i consider myself a roosevelt democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtletyof course the problem could be with me i see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture alas not i the only thing that kept me from giving this a was the nice scenery human and plant,negative
the drug years actually suffers from one of those aspects to mini series or other kinds of tv documentaries run over and over again for a couple of weeks on tv its actually not long enough in a way all of the major bases in the decades are covered and theyre all interesting to note as views into post modern history and from different sides but it almost doesnt cover enough or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time for example the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs partly the marijuana later cocaine is really well presented but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to coveroverall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs pop culture government intervention the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia all felt the wave of various drugs over the years and the interplay between all was very evident nobody in the film except for the possibility of small hints with the pot goes to endorse drugs outright but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun and then tragic about taking certain drugs the appearances of various staunch ridiculously anti drug officials does hammer some points down hard with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and americas connection as a whole as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees the only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not just say no because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought it is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them as for example oxycontin continues on in the marketplaceis it with the great interest and depth of a ken burns documentary no but for some summertime tv viewing for the young ie my age who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago as well as for the old who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks careless times and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it there are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased which is not totally untrue but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social political and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving for better or obvious worse for enough of a fascinating view,positive
i just cant believe some of the comments on this show the show is just genius sure it doesnt follow the tried and true but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again shouldnt we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while the style is not as realistic as previous scooby doo shows but its not supposed to be the show it titled shaggy and scooby doo get a clue what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action and nowhere does it say that theyd be solving mysteries and they cant even stand monsters so why would they im actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby doo show they still have running jokes clumsy hi jinks quick change outfits in chase scenes the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks in fact im glad that this show is out there because i just love it im even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villainsure its ridiculous its supposed to be sure its different its supposed to be its supposed to make you laugh at the villain and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin no matter what the size youre supposed to get the running roobi roo joke the whole thing is just put together so well there isnt a single thing i can think that is wrong with it the writing the acting the animation all top notch the title music is awesome my computer plays get a clue when it boots up and the background music is just gripping,positive
this is one of three s movies that i can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately still overlooked one of the others was clownhouse directed by victor salva a movie horribly overlook due to salvas legal sexual problems another would be camerons closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated not great but not nearly as bad as the reviews ive seen paper house is well worth your time and i think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think i mean years after ive seen it and i still give it some pause whereas something that i might have seen months ago has gone into the ether,positive

heres another entertaining clint eastwood action suspense film i am not a particularly fan of his but i have to hand to him he knows how to make entertaining movies this is one more example it didnt hurt either to have john malkovich as his co star now there is an intense actor in this story malkovich plays an assassin and he is fascinating to watch thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialog he was given he also has a interesting voicerene russo is fairly low key for her but thats fine and eastwood plays the usual loner cop role not appreciated by his superiors but showing them all up in the end i guess he couldnt stop playing the dirty harry type figures but he played them wellthere were some negatives this film however namely credibility in parts as there were a couple of times had this been real life the killer would have done away with eastwood the climatic scene in particularly had too many holes in it there also were too many abuses of lords name in vain in hereoverall however this is good escapist fare,positive
the name of this film and the clips that i saw caused me to believe that this film would have excitement and interesting moments i was disappointed the desert sands were interesting but this film inched along at a snails pace it started fine with an underground cave and something coming out but then tried to involve us with the lives of some very unlikeable human beings as they found dead bodies or should i say skeletons with some flesh on them they began a search for the reason why at times it became somewhat different as something was following them in the desert some type of black ooze or something that would begin to eat the flesh of humans as the flesh was munched upon a bag of bones began to creep after the remaining humans the reason for this black ooze as we find out was pretty bad ants unbelieveable then the ending made no sense i guess the motto of this film will be when you have an itch and see an ant quickly kill it before the ants friends smell your flesh,negative

if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over hour movie about the french revolution and also didnt have any sets and had to have my year old autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors i could find were the people who didnt make the auditions of that years soap opera and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didnt work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldnt stop oh and if i hated my audience then i might make something kind of like this awful yet mistakenly hilarious hell worthy waste of time the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel space laser battle i dont mean to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it but thats not how it ends the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review peace,negative
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this theres a bunch of apes wandering about mumbling b acting supposedly silly and we are supposed to laugh there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period i cant believe theres even a sequel to this,negative
as a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event i was very disappointed with the movie granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the hollywood portrayal of this british little big horn was truly boringthe amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history eveytime i heard triumphant background music begin i knew i had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their moneys worthdespite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed whenever peter otoole or burt lancaster finished a scene i would cringe with disappointment their given lines were so weak and meaningless that i could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed lawrence of arabia and the bird man of alcatraz respectivelythere are worse epics but this one is not much better,negative
stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isnt real he grows up and becomes an adult brandon maggart who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice one christmas he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people dressed as santa of courseboring and just plain bad killer santa movie if youre looking for gore its not here only a few of the murders are shown and theyre not that gory with very fake effects most of the movie just contains brandon maggart talking to himself and slowly going crazy the script is trite the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack jawed at the tv seriously i had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasnt hallucinating really really poor endingif you want a scary christmas flick rent black christmas the original s version not the terrible remake avoid this one at all costs,negative
this film is hilarious brilliant comedy but only because of one actor chris farley the best comedy actor i have ever seen its something special about him he is just so funnywhat a shame he is not with us anymore he will sorely be missed,positive

after what i thought was a masterful performance of two roles in man from snowy river why was kirk douglas replaced by brian dennehy in the sequel it just wasnt the same without spur and harrison as portrayed by douglas maybe he recognized how poor the plot was jim returns after extended absence to find jessica being pursued by another man he could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him and not find competition for a disney movie this contains foul language plus the highly unnecessary part when jim jessica shacked up without being married very lame quite an insult to viewer intelligence according to members of my family ill stick with the first one and try to forget i ever saw the sequel,negative
the first two thirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting betty as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol comes across as a pleasant girl next door type who saw nothing wrong with what she did and there certainly wasnt anything wrong with it director mary harron who also made i shot andy warhol and american psycho recreates bettys america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new degraded black and white footage once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny yeager color is introduced bettys notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw lili taylor in a great performance and chris bauer as well as john willie jared harris the scenes where harron recreates bettys bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed the early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world because the films third act is virtually non existent we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama flaws aside its a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon,positive
highly suggest not to watch this film tv if not mentally mature enough the film create quite realistic simulation with the steps how they prevent from terrorism if such touch wood incident happened london suppose a lovely and chill ful city while these kind of wars still going on just wasting the time and money for study and living every time passing around p square the feeling really obvious uncomfortable actually i dont want to vote the scored means nothing just fill in the blank only safty and positive thinking cities encourage better economy and investors to keep investing timeenergies and money,negative
this movie is all about blaxploitation there is absolutely no plot at all a pimp stops some bad guys with his kung fu hoes to try to get his nightclub back rated r for strong language and a brief sexual situation,positive
although it really isnt such a terribly movie especially considering it was made directly for tv distribution itll be very difficult to point out one aspect in bloodsuckers that is actually original or refreshing vampires in space isnt exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize its an incredibly stupid premise that cant possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie bloodsuckers even goes one step further and shamelessly imitates every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and intergalactic warfare the plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from john carpenters ghosts of mars and james camerons aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are crusading through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that peculiarly named themselves after notorious horror icons like the voorhees and the leatherfaces the good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clichéd issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully unimportant matters captain damian is the unpopular rookie wholl really have to prove his leadership capabilities now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved captain churchill the other annoying characters include a typical cowboy style and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board shes of asian descent like the girl in aliens was latino and the armys most valuable secret weapon a blade girl quintana is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans she can spot enemies when theyre still light years away and she can also do wickedly sexy things with someones wet dreams they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire meanie michael ironside in yet another downgrading role bloodsuckers is an irredeemably stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings infantile dialogs and ott make up effects it only gets intolerably boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the umpteenth time and bla bla bla this film is a non stop series of lame clichés and uncreative ideas but at least its watchable,negative
i really hoped for the best with this one but it just didnt happen financed at a very non dutch manner and still looking great with a style and pace thats very much like hollywood what i dont understand is how with all these great benefits the directorwriterproducer still managed to make this film a completely horrible picture to watch filled with bad jokes cheap nudity and actors that just cant really talk act in the english language kudos for pulling it off but what was this guy thinking,negative
im a fan of jeff bridges so i snapped this up on dvd without having seen it previously i instantly became a fan of kevin spacey alsothe general plot of alien in human body has in my experience been done to death but i liked the approach taken in k pax which struck me as quite different and much more sensitive than most bridges makes an excellent doctor you want to tell him whats on your mind and spaceys expressions and gestures are perfect in the rolethe interaction between prot and the entirely human characters in the clinic is delightful particularly the subtle manipulation of their behaviourthe ending is bittersweet i like prots choice but the final scenes with bridges made me teary,positive
death wish is exactly what a bad movie should be terrible acting implausible scenerios ridiculous death scenes creepy evil for no reason villains the last minutes of this movie just might be the best minutes ever put on film especially in the scene where the decent hardworking citizens string chains across the street knocking down the evil bikers and then shoot them only to be joined by the neighborhood children in celebration and how can i forget the elderly woman with the broom shes sweeping out the scum and if thats not enough lets not forget how quickly the punks give up after fraker is killed im laughing just thinking about iti also love the death scene of kerseys girlfriend he just walks away after seeing her get blown up its little things like this that make death wish such a bad movie and im not even mentioning the bizarre soundtracki watched this movie because of martin balsam who i seriously think is one of the finest character actors ever and whos own getting beaten up by the scum scene is hilarious and i walked away with a new favorite movie thank you death wish for making me laugh so hardsome other things i forgot to mention the weird sound effect after kersey says cash when buying his used car ha its so evil sounding mandy fraker mandy did the writers run out of tough guy names the fact that the gangs apparently have a lend and lease thug exchange program i need some more guys and that mandy has a working phone line in an abandoned building at the end of the movie after kersey blows up fraker is it just me or does it look like the street gang is about to break into choreography as theyre giving up just watch how in sync they are after the female punk gives the stop signal i love this movie nothing cheers me up like death wish,positive
oh dear god this was horrible there is bad then there was this this movie makes no sense at all it runs all over the map and isnt clear about what its saying at all the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman the fact that edison isnt a real city takes away since i live in vancouver watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable why didnt they make it a real city the only writing that was decent wastilman in which john heard did a fantastic job he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time and the movie be a washout too bad hopefully someone important will see it and at least give john heard credit where credit is due and hire him as lead bad guy again which is where he should be on the a list,negative
a four and a half hour oneill play gets boiled down to a little under two and much of that running time is devoted to actors with frozen expressions on their faces as they read their characters thoughts in voice over it can work onstage but it looks hilariously stilted in this soap opera adaptation which soft peddles its heroines bad behavior and never explains why she has so captivated so many men norma shearer and alexander kirkland overacting ludicrously are outclassed by a naturalistic clark gable hes the only one who makes the frozen face technique work it gets even funnier when shearers and gables son a surly moppet does the frozen face shtick there are also frank morgans brother ralph as an unsuccessful suitor given to soliloquizing poor charlie over and over again and a young robert young and maureen osullivan by the time they show up the voice overs have largely been abandoned and it plays as a ripe soap with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays silver threads among the gold as background music robert leonards direction is stodgy and he shows little facility for reining in hyperactive actors its certainly entertaining theres nothing else like it unless you count grouchos satirical parody in animal crackers or an old mad magazine satire that rendered shirley booths sitcom hazel a la strange interlude but it isnt good,negative
movie didnt have much plot and was uninteresting basically you spend a lot of time watching people paint also its very difficult to hear or understand the dialogue partially because of the accents but also because words are mumbled,negative
steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worsethis one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people in self defence hes active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the cliché evil english villain that hollywood is so obsessed with including these dayssuffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isnt interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the lesbian interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isnt even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didnt need toin short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worsesave minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are seagals most ardent fan,negative
like an earlier commentor i saw it in and have never been able to shake the memory of the gripping story splendid acting and dramatic musical score it certainly contains some of sam waterstons finest work he and the writers depict oppenheimer not simply as an unjustly victimized hero which he was but also as naive fond of alcohol and snobbish a rounded portrait instead of a stereotype,positive
a guy with the unlikely name of shy walker looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half thats the entire plotwith across the board bad acting of course walker wanders around a corn maze maize i get it hahahanot funny and yells girls where are you about times for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin a chipmunk sounding voice laughs as if the pumpkin is laughing at him yeah ok his daughters scream for most of the movieeven when there is no reason to scream maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie twin girls straight out of the shining show up every now and then most of the corn maze looks the same so walkers search gets very old very quickly the filmmakers realize there is nothing going for this movie even the music is repetitive so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast filming upside down inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles using red lights to make the corn look scary and rotating the camera degrees at least im assuming these were done intentionally but its likely just examples of incompetent film making more often than not when walker is wandering through the maze you cant see his face i guess the kid holding the camera cant look up that high this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original dark harvest which doesnt have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield dont be fooled by the r rating walker says the f word three times and now we have an r rated horror movie ugh the scarecrow on the cover doesnt even show up in this movieand when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back you know things are bad instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around unfortunately he is dressed similar to mr walker so i didnt even realize he was being followed for a while i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before walker did the movie is almost over by the time he puts and together natch the end of the movie drags on and onand just in case it isnt slow enough theres some slow motion the last sound you hear besides your own laughter is very poor sound dubbing in case you cant tell this is the worst movie ive ever seen at least they didnt end with the promise of another sequel,negative
i found it highly interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own american culture and that of the originators ie chinese it becomes a story about values and causes the watcher to reevaluate their own choices in life and loyalties toward institutions amazingly enough it managed to do this in a gentle mildly humorous manner which only in retrospect seens threatening to ones status quo i enjoyed the movie and would watch it again if i could,positive
this film is not really a remake of the obrien film which is excellent it borrows the main premise a man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer but i like that the writers chose an english professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist the plot is also quite original in general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake but what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous s original music scorecombined with an affected noir feel dennis quaid grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but hes still compelling in a general way meg ryan is fine as the student helper love interest when the film gets sort of bad is when dex the prof meets the british bodyguard chauffeur and their duels are pretty laughable the bodyguard works for the rich widow played by lovely charlotte rampling but those scenes are too self consciously noir to help the film along even though the family plot line is rather interesting dex also keeps showing up at the same place and finding this bodyguard which is rather coincidental in the latter part of the filma man is shot by a window and from the outside you see him jump out of it that was pretty bad direction but aside from some of these obvious flaws i think it still holds ok i certainly didnt predict the ending so that was good there is a twist and although some posters here think they were misled i thought it was a fine and believable ending dennis quaid with his weird smirks and black eyes is more likable in the right stuff great balls of fire inner space and cold creek manor but here as dex hes supposed to be somewhat of a jerk so he did fine fairly decent movie,positive
i have seen this film several times and watched it today on tcm solely because of geraldine fitzgerald she is a much underrated actress and i have to admit i have had a crush on her since i first saw her probably in wuthering heights or more years ago the real star in this movie however is paul lukas and he deserved all the accolades he got he makes it clear whether we like it or not that the end justifies the means naziism had to be stopped and anything that helped do it was good he gave his children a line about being bad and that they should not be bad but as he said earlier when conversing with adults he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to dosome people think his victim was a nazi but i dont think so i think he was only after the money his nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for himone interesting point in the film and presumably also in the play is the fact that muller lucas is a german while the anti german hysteria of wwi was not repeated in wwii there was considerable anti german sentiment and some germans were interred similar to what happened in california with people of japanese ancestry it was something of an act of bravery for hellman to write a play about good germans at this time maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the nazi soviet pact after all the us and british air forces were bombing german cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians i think however that the dresden bombing and firestorm happened later after watch on the rhine was releasedthe title is something of a play on words as the watch is looking west from germany in fact watch am rhein was a german army marching song used in wwii but the nazis had their own marching song that was used as well but muller is a german and he is engaged in his own wach am rheinall the other actors did an excellent job here although bodo was too much there are children like him i am surprised he did not give his fathers secret away in real life he may very well have done so,positive
this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that were plunged into a semi cheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities its a slow uphill set up kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school horror steve johnsons make up effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups the tongue in cheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on a double bill with the remake of house on the haunted hill the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking,positive
okay maybe it was because i happen to be in yangchun china when i saw this movie maybe it was because i finally had something on tv i could understand or at least read the subtitles or maybe it was just funny whatever it was this movie was worth the timei had just arrived for my foot and head massage when they gave me the remote so i could watch tv usually i would turn the darn thing off but i stumbled upon this crazy movie and got hookedthe plot if you could call it a plot sort of revolves around a cooking competition and sort of is a love story and the food in this movie is the real star if you like iron chef and many of the other cooking shows currently in the reality tv mode then you will love the scenes with food in this movieit goes fast and the subtitles are so fast you better be up on speed reading for this one however the action is mostly slapstick so you dont always have to read the entire subtitle to get the ideathe main actress is lovely eye candy and the main actor isnt bad to look at either they are both worth watching finally if you have some time to kill and want a good laugh this isnt a bad choice for bothi dont speak a word of chinese but i was totally able to understand the cultural humor of this film for those who do speak chinese maybe it is even better overall i give this an out of and currently i am even looking to find a copy to have while i stay in china and keep for when i come back home it will be a nice reminder for me of my time in yangchun and a silly afternoon at the massage salon watching a silly movie,positive
the saving grace of this film is its humour playing up to the strengths of their star warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky dashing irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism it was robin hood all over again and flynn blossomed in the role all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing and this one was no exceptionit also benefits from the return of former co star olivia de havilland despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership the part of strong minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynns later films and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part in this final collaboration she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is at heart basically a romping adventure movie and the screen chemistry is rekindled for once she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple to equally winning effectthe flynn de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this films durability when most of flynns other westerns held in such affection by the contemporary american public although allegedly not by their star have long since been forgotten the action scenes are fairly cursory despite ironically the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges and the villains of the piece turn out schoolboy fashion to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career it cuts down on the cast list but its a trifle too morally convenienthowever these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players memorably including anthony quinn in an all but wordless role as the sioux leader errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal charmingly sheepish looks unexpected sweetness mischievous twinkles flash point indignation cheerful fellowship and sheer high octane charisma hes a reckless braggart but you cant help but like him and its hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafterthis is one of flynns lasting hits it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun and is a film worthy of being remembered,positive
one of the worst movies ive ever seen with robert de niro the fan is a pointless cliché of an exercise in slasher flicks it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic the movie meanders into nothing spoiler were to believe that a knife wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness security or cameras the movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky not sure what all the actors were thinking when they got onboard this razzie this is as big a dud as they come stay far away if you prefer thought in your movies,negative
eric bogosians ability to roll from character to character in this one man show exhibits his true range as a character actor each persona has their own message to convey about truth society class drugs etc this is an absolute must have for anyone who is a serious fan of acting his performance contains some of the most hilarious and real moments i have ever experienced as a viewing audience,positive
nice character development in a pretty cool milieu being a male im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound a lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,positive
with an opening segment that imitates the music and cinematography of todd hayness safe david lynch uses dream myth and warped notions of reality to tell the fractured story of a failed bit part hollywood actress waitress diane selwyn let down by fame and her own demons and obsessed with camilla rhodes who is engaged to hotshot director adam kesherthe film effectively takes place in dianes drug fueled head we are witness to her crazy distortions her wish fulfillments regrets obsessions and fears using the dream narrative as a way of presenting two notions of reality in conflict lynch does not simplify the opposition between reality and fantasy but actively entangles them the last minutes are as dream like as what came before and the troublesome air of detached otherworldly ambiguity still pervades fracturing the seemingly secure distinction between reality and dream we expect to see in films about nightmares and dreamslynchs film borrows from many films old and new but ultimately is a film unlike any other with the exception of the directors own lost highway and blue velvet it constantly challenges the viewer to interpret what is seen not only intuitively but intellectually yet it is not as pretentious as one would have imagined because lynch makes us sympathize with the protagonist despite her murderous deeds an element that was missing in all of his other films except the straight story he does this by presenting dianes dream alter ego betty as a wholesome canadian farm girl destined for fame lynch also presents us with an intriguing story that affirms and negates in equal measure are camilla and diane really lovers or just friends who is the blue lady what does she signify who is the bum behind winkies what is the significance of the rotting corpse at sierra bonita does aunt ruth really exist is silencio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a self referential take on the films status as fiction lynch isnt prepared to answer any question he poses choosing instead to present his love story in the city of dreams as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifsthe acting is top rate especially naomi watts as diane selwyn betty who is yet to eclipse this performance laura harring has the requisite hayworthesque allure as camilla rita while adam theroux as adam brings an freewheeling arrogance and sublimated paranoid aggression to his role it was staggering and a grave injustice that not one of them was even nominated for an academy awardthis is a film that demands to be seen and analyzed closely the mystery at the heart of the film remains in lynchs hands but half the fun is finding consistent ideas from the maze of seeming incongruities that he presents upon closer inspection there is a definite sense of a puzzle perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that teases us with closure but denies the imaginary plenitude of narrative coherence ultimately this is lynchs key film,positive
preposterous sequel stretches credibility to a great degree as diabolical sociopath stanley kaldwell returns this time infiltrating the movie production of the novel he wrote for the garden drownings assuming the identity of a second unit director he murderedfilm pokes gleeful fun at hollywood with a tongue in cheek script taking shots at tyrannical directors who sleep with their actresseslooking for a way up the ladderand dislike anyone challenging them for complete spotlight brian krause who i thought was dreadful overacting to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced portrays the loud temperamental director who doesnt like the fact that his second unit director and screenplay writer alisonplayed by dahlia salemseem to be taking over the production andrew moxham is paul parsons who is the brother of a victim from the first film the films dark humor this time takes the idea of a serial killer actually operating as director of a movie set and exploits it for all its worth nelson again ably slides back into his psycho role without any difficulty with stanley as clever as ever using his brains to commandeer a film production killing whoever he has to in order to maintain full control of his work letting no one stand in his waythat is until alison realizes who stanley really is alison is the type of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her subjectwhat motivated stanley to kill why would he do such a thing and what led such a man down this dark path the humor of alison actually working with that very man is also part of the satire at the heart of this dark comedy thriller of course you get the inevitable showdown between alison and stanley with a really ridiculous unbelievable conclusion regarding the killers fatequite a hard pill to swallow unlike the first film which was photographed with sophisticated polish director po chih leong uses unnecessary techniques which are not neededsuch as shooting an all kinds of weird angles slow motion in a sepia color and several instances which are captured on videoand rather annoy instead of impress this sequel to me just wasnt on target as much as the original with a lot of the humor less effective and more obvious,negative
unfortunately there was not a for a rating or else i wouldve chosen it this movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance carol burnett albert finney tim curry bernadette peters edward hermann the innocence of newcomer aileen quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro john huston father of actress angelica hustonis what made this film so charming even the remake with kathy bates victor garber alan cumming and kristin chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel before she did this movie all ashley johnson was known for was her role as little chrissie seaver on the prime time show growing pains she had a few bit parts in movies but i dont know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own and adding joan collins as lady edwina hogbottom ridiculous they couldnt get good enough actors to play the major roles like daddy warbucks miss hannigan and annie but they will sign joan collins to play some british lady it doesnt surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was the critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for tv it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie,negative
this superior inferiority to the original dumb blind dead movie is another trash bin waste so many people have hyped up these films that i cant believe what they say about it since i was a kid i have heard about how scary and great these films are and i saw them all and was throughly disappointed was everyone on drugs from the s or do they just not know how boring this crude is,negative
i remember watching attack when it first came out and caught it again recently the sci fi channel has run worse but not by much a shameless ripoff of jurassic park attack substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs and they are on the loose devouring as many extras as possible the cgi is pretty bad and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable we get some gore which helps a little wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it other than robert carradine who has very little to do the cast is unknown apparently this was shot in fiji nice work if you can get it reminds me of all those low budget monster stvs that were popular in the s and s,negative
in terms of the arts the s were a very turbulent era in literature and the visual arts it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted in music it was a decade that many see as a low point due to corporate rock and disco on television it was a golden age for situation comedies from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to mash to all in the family but in film it was even a greater period of creativity in all genres that saw the rise of the american auteur directors like robert altman francis ford coppola and martin scorsese from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century these directors wanted to craft literate arts films for the masses of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war yet the studios were trying to keep pace with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the sbut unlike the films of the s starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield usually co starring the dead end kids that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage the social consciousness of the late s and early s manifested itself most in science fiction films which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment there was precedent for this approach for several of the flying saucer films of the s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers and the early s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running george lucass first film thx which dealt with consumerism group think and existentialism and logans run which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual some of the films references are quite heavyhanded and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation a few jarred strawberries cost and soylent rations its assorted colored foods soylent yellow soylent red and the new soylent green reputedly made from the finest undersea growth in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the films release and the scenes of crowding and bodies live and dead lying all about are still chilling as well as influential a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny the rest of the script by stanley r greenberg however is rather pedestrian and fairly standard for a dystopian flick but fleischer and cinematographer richard h kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds to spice things up the use of soft dimly lit visuals murkily filtered add a stygian feel to the new york of the film almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyers vampyr the only light in the film comes from artificial sources and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timelessthe end of the film where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers is both chilling and oddly drama less in the end the soylent minions hunt thorn down but he survives long enough to utter the films catchphrase to chief hatcher yet one does not know if it is enough for hatcher has already been co opted and has a track record of taking the easy way out yet that fact and its ambiguity shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters dilemmas and has a depth many later better made films sci fi or not do not have it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching,positive
i saw this film at a time when i was timidly toying with the idea of moving into my own apartment and starting life on my own maybe that is the reason why i took it so seriously i believed totally in the poor characters psychological degradation inside a paris of perpetual construction sites dust squalor selfishness rudeness malice and decay im giving all the credit to polanskis artistry in his direction his playing and his inescapable script but i fainted during the horrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theatres manager luckily for me my life on my own didnt turn out as disastrous as this so far but i have always kept a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so totally immerse himself in the fake reality he is trying to convey simply put the man is a genius of the first order and a credit to the human race this film is the sum of many many instances of great acting and great casting as some performances were done in english the scenes with shelley winters and melvyn douglas among others and others in french with most other characters and polanski did his own dubbing in english and french i heartily recommend if you happen to be bilingual to switch the audio from french to english and vice versa during the appropriate scenes while watching the magnificent transfer on paramount dvd this film is part of polanskis so called apartment building trilogy which also comprises repulsion and rosemarys baby unfortunately repulsion still hasnt made it to a decent dvd transfer in region needless to say the three films would make a magnificent boxset,positive
warning this review may contain spoilers the idea behind the character of danny jet li is a good one young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neckhowever the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believabilityhe has danny meeting a blind pianist sam morgan freeman who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was along with his nit wit endlessly babbling rather unattractive step daughter victoria kerry condon i was stunned by the way when i learned victoria was supposed to be she looked or to meamazingly there is no romance between danny and victoriawhen danny turns up again wounded what does sam do but take him straight home danny is out for days but do these nit wits take him to a hospital nooooo i dont know if they even called in a doctornow danny is obviously not a mentally stable person this is apparent from the get go yet sam takes him into his home where both he and his step daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange young manwhy morgan freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film i cant even begin to guess surely mr freeman is not that desperate for a paycheckthen we have bob hoskins as bart the gangster who owns danny now you talk about a son of a gun thats hard to kill the car bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled bonnie and clydes demise we think hes dead but nothen we have another car accident and yet again ol bart escapes unscathedin addition to that we also have danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time plus a scene where danny has decided he doesnt want to fight any more i dont care how much a person doesnt want to fight when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die i think anyone would fightas i said in the subject heading this film is about miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it its not just a case of suspending belief its completely beyond thatfurthermore i never did understand why dannys mother who turns out to be a nice lady rather than the prostitute bart claimed she is became mixed up with bart and his gang and got shot maybe that was my fault i got distracted right about the time that scene came on but it seemed highly unlikely she and bart would have ever crossed paths stars out of and thats being generous,negative
i like the wind and the lion very much it was a good movie i thought that since im young and it was made so long ago i wouldnt like it all that good but after i saw it i was amazed of how good it was my family liked it my friends liked it everyone i showed it to liked it i liked it because it showed how arabs and people in morroco was treated during the early s by the germans french and even the americans if i was a high school history teacher i would definitely show it to my students from a high schoolers point of view i give this movie a good out of my grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves my little year old cousins even sit down and watched itsystemoffell,positive
i saw this film last night about minutes and dont know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i dont see how gere a buddhist got involved in this violent sexist trash,negative
the trouble with this film like so many other films that fail is the scriptthe script is so unfocused it flounders around all over the place what is the story here ok its a biopic but i think everyone will agree there is no way that an entire life can be condensed into or so minutes some selection and editing is required but this script just didnt select or edit enough it didnt render hoffmans life down to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through them get the bigger picture of the whole manthe movie wanders from being a straight plodding troubled genius biopic to semi docu mocu mentary using new shots faked up to match archive footage to sub true life sob stories movie of the week the whole im bringing up a son who doesnt know im his dad shtick to political conspiracy theory movie etc etc it just never makes its mind up what it wants to be and the half hearted citizen kane like narrative structure reporter interviewing people from hoffmans past is soon abandoned which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it starts outthe movie is full of moments and incidents that contribute nothing to the story and could well have been cut to leave room to expand something more important the whole scene in the psychiatrists office after vincent donofrio pounds the window screaming im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im abbie hoffman im acting im acting im acting could have easily been cut all that happens is the psychiatrist says you have bipolar disorder heres some lithium and the two women in his life say we could see you weekends more often and bang thats it no more mental health problems it is such a laughably pointless tokenistic scene it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot the scene where they all get high and watch newsreel footage from viet nam and hoffman phones god pointless tells us nothing about anything yet when it comes to a pivotally important moment like the drugs bust the film making is so hurried the situation just comes out of leftfield and doesnt make any sense to the audience suddenly hes dealing in heroin where did this come from why what is going on here i being a middle aged leftie would guess i am sitting well within the target audience for this movie but even i got fed up with the portrayal of the man the pigs the fuzz etc as brutal be suited unthinking hippie hating androids it may have been like that in s america i dont know i wasnt there but in film terms it was cheap clumsy polemichaving said all that vincent donofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger hoffman and i could watch janeane garofalo in anything even reading a bus timetable though she just wasnt right for this part,negative
chris gerolmo took care not to simply give us a jack the stripper type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results perhaps mostly due to stephen reas excellent performance playing off against donald sutherland with good empathy by both it was the playing of these two parts above all which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of rostov supporting actors especially max von sydow carried out their parts really well good directing the photography was good too needless to say the fact that the film was shot in hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the story telling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialiafor once a made for tv film from hbo has come up trumps recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes which i hasten to add are never exaggerated,positive
this film is absolutely hilarious basically the plot revolves around a serial killer being somehow turned into a snowman through some b movie chemical accident he then heads for town and starts terrorising the locals its up to the local police chief and some other characters to try and stop him its made on a wee budget and it certainly shows but the great thing about this film is it knows that its rubbish the improvisations of styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic and this is clearly the intention its one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point alongside the comic tackiness there are some other great comedy moments listen out right in the beginning for the voice over of a dad scaring his kids to death and the funniest rape scene ever committed to film fantastic tacky fun,positive
on top of the fact that skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while without giving away any spoilers as if it matters with this piece of crap his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucksin addition if you read in the credits they re stage some of the phone calls etc because they dont pan outthe whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for freewhat is the con,negative
this is a gem as a film four production the anticipated quality was indeed delivered shot with great style that reminded me some errol morris films well arranged and simply gripping its long yet horrifying to the point its excruciating we know something bad happened one can guess by the lack of participation of a person in the interviews but we are compelled to see it a bit like a car accident in slow motion the story spans most conceivable aspects and unlike some documentaries did not try and refrain from showing the grimmer sides of the stories as also dealing with the guilt of the people don left behind him wondering why they didnt stop him in time it took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well made documentary,positive
my parents may enjoy this show but i fail to find the humor in it what is so funny about a dentist husband impregnating his hygienist assistant and the oldest daughter getting impregnated by the captain of the high school football team absolutely nothing its a shock to me sometimes what people think constitutes humor nowadays blame that on shows like the dating game and the newlywed game bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid s sure the series has its touching moments still thats no excuse for the content that otherwise went into this series this is nothing like the family oriented days of i love lucy some five decades before an answer i would have to why this series plays on the lifetime cable channel is because that channels brass think women can relate to rebas character i absolutely dislike the character of reba harts daughter kyra she is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager funny i wonder if the actress who played kyra scarlett pomers is like that in real life away from acting who plays the blockhead ex husband dentist christopher rich is not much better barbara jean played by melissa peterman is ditsy in herself the characters of van and cheyenne are also very annoyingsomething else that baffles me is why the dingbat of a series creator allison m gibson decided to set the series in where i live miles away from houston texas reba mcentire isnt even from this state shes an oklahoman why is it during one season or more they decided to make the incidental music sound like a pig snorting what i mean by that is where we hear this baritone saxophone being played with drums accompanying it but the melodies are basically tuneless,negative
at least it is with this episode here we have a time traveler the professor from gilligans island no less going back in time to what does one do why try to save lincoln of course no really interesting variations are rung on this old theme as another reviewer has stated this episode is particularly drab and unstylish with little to suggest that the professor really is back in the s budget limitations are readily apparent and the direction is stolid john wilkes booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production we too often feel we are on stage sets waiting for something clever to happen there is a minor twist at the end but i emphasize minor,negative
as i sat in the theater almost crying to myself in dismay over the atrocity ron howard and tom hanks call the da vinci code i could not see the light at the end of the tunnel that is angels and demonshanks and company are back for the sequel prequel angels and demons and they have learned their lessonacting wise everyone is much better aylet zurer is very good as vittoria vetra and better than the girl who played sophie neveau tom hanks is very good as always he is better in this though because he works harder at giving the movie the feeling that it is a thriller i think ewan mcgregor does the best job of any of the actors he might even deserve a nomination come march but doubtful he had me convinced right until the very end hes dynamic and faithful but rational and realizes that the church needs to put their past behind them the minor actors also do very good jobstechnically and visually the movie is much improved the cinematography is muchmuch better and the visual effects are superb the final explosion sequence at the end is excellent howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour of romepacing wise ron howard does an amazing job this time around at keeping the story moving and not boring us with a history lesson deemed at denouncing christianity the movie also makes you feel like more is at stake in our feeble minds discovering whether or not jesus had children is not as high up on the list compared to a cataclysmic explosion killing thousands including the roman catholic church part of the reason i think the story is so fast paced is due to the excellent score i cannot say enough about the score it was epic at times like something from lord of the rings but then sometimes it felt like a bourne movie which is a nice mixmy only complaint about this movie is that it is ridiculously far fetched the chances of the carmelengo being someone of ewan mcgregors age are highly improbable and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son getting elected pope are even more ridiculous not to mention the whole antimatter thing which has yet to be created and dan brown wrote the book in overall angels and demons is much tighter knitt faster paced more exciting and more important movie than the da vinci code this is must see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one,positive
do not watch this sad excuse for a film i have wasted time and money on this and am pretty psed off about itthe acting is comparable with high school plays the script is shocking there is no plot twenty minutes from the end which i believe i should be rewarded for reaching i had a headache from all the screaming crying and wailing the five girls makethe majority of the violence is rare for a film nowadays suggested rather than graphically depicted but i found the characters so damn irritating that i wanted to see them and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of st die in the most horrible ways possiblei spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor minutes of yours dont do it,negative
set in japan ashura is the story of demons taking over the earth the premise is far more complicated but the arching storyline should not be forgotten japan is in turmoil with demons occupying human form roaming the lands generally speaking demons look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of ogre which is a mythological creature of some historic stature were talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child eating monstershowever in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress in order to save the world from demons there are demon slayers trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the passage way between the realm of hell and that of the real world these are the basic premisesthe story begins with a festival in a local town amid these festivities men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing harm the villagers run excepting those which are demonic in nature who turn green eyed and try to kill them the demon slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons from here the story gets interesting the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune telling demon appears before the gate keepers revealing the arrival of ashura with it comes the end of the reign of man and begins the reign of demons ashura however requires some form of birthing process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which wont be revealed to you until you see the film the demon slayers are a wise old man a powerful yet unprincipled man and a skilled and compassionate warrior immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with she in turn is a brigand who is good natured sought after by authorities when the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her shoulder and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder needless to say the mark is not a good sign what ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itselfthe point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would i came in thinking it would either be a fast paced action style film with demons or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in ringu and ju on i was however mistaken in the best possible way the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play and it plays itself out as such combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath awaythe film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera work comparable to many great samurai films of our days but adding to it a well thought and classical plot with great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my bookthat being said it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone its not cheap thrills horror its not balls to the wall action its a horror style play thats been filmed it has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional one liners like japanese plays the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something elseoverall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you riveted and amused it has good writing good acting and good direction it is all in all a solidly great film,positive
in war inc we find the logical extension of the current outsourcing of all war related activities we are currently doing in afghanistan and iraq if you are familiar with the antics of halliburton kellogg brown root and blackwater overseas you are already halfway home to fully appreciating the satire of cusacks latest piece cusack plays a corporate hit man named brand hauser who finds himself in turiquistan organizing a trade show in the newly liberated country as his cover while waiting to get access to his latest target while there he finds himself intrigued by the anti establishment reporter played by marisa tomei and pursued by the over sexualized pop star played by hilary duff we are introduced to hausers past which includes a tragedy that has haunted him ever since and the corporate assistant named marsha dillon who actually is running the entire operation for him and played hilariously by joan cusack while some moments are played suitably over the top they arent always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you by surprise all the principals turn in solid performances duffs accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very nice job and goes a long way to dispel her disney image tomei is funny but understated while the cusacks own nearly every scene they are in to be fair they are given good material the writers turn in a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to keep you giggling throughout all the way to the predictable conclusion in fact the predictability of the end is the only thing that keeps me from rating it higher as the story twists and turns its way to the expected conclusionif you like your comedy broad and physical there is probably not enough here to keep you interested the entire movie on the other hand if you like sly comedy and broad satire this is for you,positive
this is not as bad a movie as some reviewers and as the summary at the imdb page for this movie say it is why first is the fact that in the movie makers were daring enough to confront as one of the plot elements the issue of domestic violence so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points second without the plot element of princes movie relationship with his abusive father the musical climax wouldnt work as well as it does so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have once again missed one of the points specifically why it is so goodbecause all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective third give this movie a break for first time movie producers and director this is just not that bad there are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people and last the reviewers who say that the music is good have also missed the point check out the range of stylistic musical treatments the variety the musicianship and the stage performance of prince truly one of a kind going musically where no one else was going during the s and with a style seen in the work of other artists clothes and movement which costuming elements came first michael jacksons or princes also see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that prince does in this movie long before quentin tarentinos pulp fiction as the sum of its parts not a bad movie at all,positive
this movie has one of the cheesiest plots i have seen for me thats what makes it so awesome fred gwynne and al lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original munsters series while there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically i wish yvonne de carlo as lily would have had more plot involvement she showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie this movie also stars the great sid caesar but sadly he doesnt have any interaction with gwynne and lewis i think some better work could have come out of that,positive
i just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one paul giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot he would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it weve had the dvd for several years and my kids boy now and girl will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that i dont mind having to hear it in the background and i do run to the tv for the really funny parts simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard,positive
i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah it is so interesting where did this guy come from now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes with his film years later it is a african issue but the idea doesnt fit that mold showing the artistic diversity the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to i just love the mild comedy in it and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing it is really a art house gem,positive
manmohan desai made some entertaining though illogical films like aaa parvarish and naseeb but he made some craps like coolie and mard and then gjsthis movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringethe british are made carricatures and the film looks so weird the scene in the british hotel is damn stupid the film has many stupidities like amrita assaulting amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse there are more gems like the horse statue getting life the masks of amitabh haha and moredirection by manmohan desai is bad music is okayamitabh does his part with style nothing different from coolie laawaris type roles amrita singh is okay satyen kapuu is okay prem chopra is as usual nirupa roy is again her usual self dara singh is also as usual,negative
another of my delves into the bargain bin this movie gave me exactly what i expected a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladiesit all started so well i liked the little intro with the newsreel about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught firefrom then onwards the film descended into outright silliness and at times became almost embarrassing to watch when the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character the ability to light ones own farts without the aid of a match it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment thatll be good you can almost hear them say as for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant wellthe movie came across as cheap tat if you pay more than for it youve been done,negative
every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should bethe plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about whats going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can bea word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bbs and lots of bloodif you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation and dont forget to switch the light offmy points on different aspects direction acting atmosphere sound effect total,positive

while i agree completely with drvn below about mary mccormack flopping a milk bag out on tv the rest of the show is fantastic phil hartman was great in a professorly way teaching the celebs the ins and outs foleys a nut but in a good way you never know what self depricating humor hes going to come up with next as for the game play its entertaining filled with witty banter and great for any newbie that may have even a passing an interest in the game too bad it isnt on anymore i just checked the schedule all the way to august and it doesnt appear to be scheduled for any time in the future bad bravo you deserve a beating,positive
dont get me wrong i love most of paul schraders movies so it was with sheer excitement i was able to attend at the rolling thunder screening at the parisian french cinemathque with surprise movie on the th dec of course the surprise movie was the exorcist and most people were there for that i was too the film was then finished but the score so p schrader used excerpts from the return of the king and some other movie i forget was it conan anyways apart from that the movie was finalized the happy few there maybe people were told to please not write about the film on the internet or magazines since it may have jeopardized its chance of getting selected to the cannes film festival then came the film then came the realization that the film might not get selected for the festival because of its quality never in my life had i experienced such a feeling of awkwardness in the audience as people went from being skeptical to plainly laughing out loud at the pity full spectacle i couldnt believe how low the author of light sleeper mishima blue collar and affliction had sunkforced over the top acting thorough stupid ending black and white moral awful fxs worst take on christianity from schrader ever not even suspenseful just boring as hell no pun intended and unsurprising at all some good locations but sadly miss used or at least not fulfilling the initial hopes in the end i was times more satisfied by the schrader penned rolling thunder and wished my hours backdont believe the hype even the john boorman movie is more exciting and original oh and the billy crawford casting the poor guy does his best but what where you expecting hes now part of the small club of worst casting mistakes ever i give the movie a just because i didnt leave the room but i should have,negative

a glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never ending wet slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes a space odyssey miles apart in vision but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless a magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn youve probably seen this scene in the trailer but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and results an avalanche the horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible the movie traces two characters a mammoth named manfred ray romano and a buck toothed sloth john leguizamo as they try to migrate south they find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them they are joined by a saber tiger named diego denis leary whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap diegos meat eating family wants the mammoth most of all but diegos learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end there are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in shrek characters contemplate on why theyre in the ice age while they could have called it the big chill or the nippy era some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends all the great guys are never around the sensitive ones get eaten throwaway lines galore whimsical comedy and light fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch also food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as good eating the vocal talents of romano leguizamo and leary make good on their personas while the children will delight in their antics the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents there is some mild violence and intense content but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age old battle of good versus evil and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties the animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic,positive
i find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid but i admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool i find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws d urville martin broke funny speaking from a film directors perspective there is times i just want to drop everything and have fun on the set this film looks like fun when other aspiring film directors ask me advice i just tell them to watch any film by rudy ray moore they always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters woody allen scorsese lucas capra i laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first,positive
the first few minutes of the bodyguard do have a campy charm it opens with crawling text from the bible the part that samuel jackson recites to his soon to be victims in pulp fiction continues with two karate school teachers in new york arguing about the eternal question of mankind who is better sonny chiba or bruce lee and then chiba appears playing himself he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand unfortunately any entertainment value intentional or unintentional soon gets crushed by the disjointed story the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action to keep it simple heres why the bodyguard is an unbearable movie to watch you dont know whats going on there are barely any fights the fights that are there are short and terribly filmedsonny chiba is cool judy lee is gorgeous her face is glorious its only for them that i give the bodyguard a nd star out of this movie makes minutes feel like hours,negative
street fight is a brilliant piece of brutal satire this is not a movie you just watch for fun it is not a comfortable experience although it does have some laugh out loud moments this is a movie you watch when you need food for thoughtto dismiss this film as simply racist is to miss the point entirely this is not only a satire of song of the south its also a biting commentary on the prejudices that americans still have as a society every ethnic group portrayed in the movie gets shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people through this wild exaggeration the filmmaker shows just how absurd these tightly held beliefs really areif youre the sort of person whos willing to acknowledge the ugliness of the prevalent prejudices american culture still holds and if youre not afraid to look your own prejudices in the eye this movie may be for you,positive
at the beginning of this film which i found myself watching on ifc in the wee hours of the morning i was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort the feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that i didnt know if i wanted to continue watchingalthough it didnt really seem to me that i had much of a choice so compelling was the situationgradually though that feeling of discomfort waned although it never really disappeared entirely and i felt drawn into tessa bobbys predicaments and really just hoping against hope that they might get back togetherreally just a moving powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package i had no idea that sarah polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia so now i love it even morei definitely recommend it if your lucky enough to catch it on the independent film channel sometime or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it,positive
it looks like the brilliant team of shonda rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore maybe to the mediocreland pp reminds me any one of the many tedious promising at first but predictable within season david kelly flicks picket fences ally mcbeal and now boston legal the crazy cases they get are so outlandish they barely evoke sympathy or sadness and thats what actually makes good medical dramas tick dramatic situations you are afraid of this could be me sentiment they are not funny eitherthe actors are quite good but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live im a therapist and let me tell you amy brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent unethical untrained therapist whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference counter transference courses in stanford somebody should give them a code of ethics to read the episode with the nose bleeding wife and the therapists involvement in it no therapists are that badwomen yearning for men who have moved on had been done to death weve all graduated sex and the city addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes very age inappropriate looks so unnatural on a woman over and this otherwise talented actress doesnt believe it herself and doesnt deliver it very well the only successful palatable developments are addison struggling with her decision to move to la and the voodoo dr and his coping with widowhoodthis concept might work with a whole new writing team,negative

after seeing meredith in beyond the prairie i had to buy another film with her staring i cannot believe how she let herself into this teenage flick its best to watch this one with the sound off but just concentrate on meredith as she moves across the screen save your money until the tv network comes out with a dvd on beyond the prairie its worth it at any price this one needs to pay you to see this pretty lady needs someone to put her into a script that can use both her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman perhaps some of her latest might fit but i havent seen them she has the smile of a cathrine bell and eyes of dana delany with a much younger body,positive
tonights film course film was the legend of the suram fortress and during its minute running time it managed to quickly jump into my top five most difficult films of all time thats difficult to watch films so different to everything else that youre seeing something totally alien a brief synopsis would be a group of georgians are trying to build a fortress to defend themselves from invaders but every time they are about to put on the finishing touches for no readily apparent reasons it collapses so they go and see a fortune teller who advises them that if they want to get the fortress to stay standing they need to find a youth a tall blonde blue eyed boy to be buried into one of the walls during the construction and his presence will ensure that the construction job will be completed smoothly and sure enough in those closing moments there he is gladly being smeared in cement and eggs giggling as hes buried alive with only his mother to grieveit actually a fairly simple story but the director sergo paradjanov working in soviet georgia in not too long after leaving a fifteen year jail term doesnt follow any of the film making rules we are used to there are very few close ups very often the action we need to be following is hidden in the bottom left hand corner of a landscape shot extra ordinarily easy to miss there are very few close ups and at times its hard to tell whose doing what to whom and why every now and then the film goes off on digressions which have no relevance to the main plot and generally serve to confuse the viewer the music is utterly mad with found sounds on screen instruments and church organ dropped in seemingly at random at times when nothing seems to be happening someone will break into a jig almost playing time until the next scene comes along but infuriatingly there is an obvious cinematic voice behind it all so youre compelled to try and understand the message whatever it is one of those times when your eyes are glued to the screen simply because you cant believe what youre seeing,negative
probably somebody heard of alberto tomba a former policeman a former sky champion and now a terrible actor alex lariete was planned to be a tv mini serial but the italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels now its a believe me ridiculous movie the script its simply hilarious its supposed to be a dramatic movie something like a years old kid work but what really blows you away its the amateurish acting alberto tomba who actually was not believable as a policeman himself plays terribly a totally silly character a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open ariete is ram this super guy will try to save a young nice girl life an actual italian little tv showgirl married to the singer eros ramazzotti nice but absolutely inept in the acting lose this one and make yourself a favour a movie that is a shame to italian cinema industry only john travolta in earth attack got close,negative
i didnt know a lot about this film going into it but i did find out that kane was a wrestler which didnt exactly thrill me but hey i liked santas slay and that had a wrestler in it so what the hell the story begins very strangely and promisingly but after a while becomes not much more than your typical teen terror slasher flick although the settings helped some a bunch of criminal young folks get rounded up and taken to an old hotel that used to be a luxury palace but is now a dump to clean it up to prepare it as a homeless shelter the driver is a man with a prosthetic arm being a veteran of the opening scene of this movie wherein he encounters this big galoot that had just killed his partner and blinded another woman the teens all being punk smart asses all of course object to having to do any real work but theyre part of some unique co ed work program yep what a great idea that is of course little does anyone suspect that there is someone lurking there in the hotel that in his own little way will save the tax payers of that state some money of course its the guy that likes to collect eyeballs and hes got quite a collection going there wont be a lot here that horror fans havent seen before but theres a few brutal scenes and sufficient gore to satisfy the hard core fan the setting of the old hotel makes a perfect spot for a slasher flick too and theres little sub stories like the search for an alleged safe full of money and the search for babes since this co ed work crew is evenly matched most of the teens are deservingly killable too so that works well not great but far better than silent hill or when a stranger calls and perhaps better than some of the other crap that i wouldnt bother to see out of,positive

this flick is worse than awful it took a good story plot and turned it into schizophrenic cinema the photography is extremely amateurish looks like a th graders home movie project filmed with malfunctioning mm kiddie cameras the editing appears to have been done by somebody having psychotic flashbacks while on drugs and booze with scenes cut short followed by other unrelated scenes then chopped segments of scenes pasted in totally unnecessary and gratuitous nudity missing scenes daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night time scenes then suddenly back to daytime obviously no continuity tom skerritt wendy hughes and james masons good acting skills are wasted as are the talents of the key supporting cast forget the villain and the anderson women very amateurish acting this movie is a good candidate for a remake even with skerritt and hughes just have it professionally done this time,negative
what can you say about a short little film filled with secondary actors and no stars with absolutely no bad performances not one poorly delivered line of dialog and with the cold violence on one hand being balanced by the warm heart of the protagonists in the story its a jewel a diamond a little valuable gem of a western that evokes the spirit and legend of the american west a west not settled by grand heroes like hickock or cody or masterson or earp but by the spread of the everyday man and woman farmers and ranch hands merchants and miners and lumbermen whores and barkeeps and entertainers of the day some looking for riches some for peace and quiet some for religious freedom it is perhaps a very spiritual story though not promoting any particular religion for even the non mormon cowboys portrayed by ben johnson and harry carey jr act in kind and noble ways toward everybody in the story regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs and go out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes upon the stranded medicine show people and in true biblical fashion like david and goliath or samson and the philistines they are the guardian angels sent to the wagon train who eventually have to go head to head with the evil incarnate clegg clan likening them to the serpent in the garden of eden and regretting what it is they have to do afterward its a sweet folkloric tale of the west that hits every target john ford takes aim atnowadays i have a western santa claus whose red outfit is covered with a denim drover coat whose red stocking cap is replaced by a brown stetson who carries a burlap bag of presents and a coil of rope to my santa i added a winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a colt revolver to tuck into his waistband when people at the office ask why my santa has to carry guns i simply reply snakes after all isnt the spirit of the christmas season one where everybody should get what they deserve fifty five years later especially post the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were back then,positive
i was lucky enough to see this at this years tribeca film festival i was stunned by how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little film was director griffin dunne has done a great job assembling this film that has several characters and several story lines that blend so smoothly and seamlessly the main story involves the family and it is very thought provoking and entertaining story that involved the viewer in every scene the film as a whole has credibility and integrity yet still has that commercial edge an indie movie for the masses if you like the performances by the cast are all excellent but it is diane lane who shines the brightest diane lane is simply sensational in this wonderful film and should be oscar nominated early days i know but lane acts her socks off here,positive

how any of you gave this more than stars amazes me i made an account on imdb just to comment on this crp film the acting is crp and the plot is crp it would deserve no stars at all if it werent for the descent soundtrack and yet there are still some outrageously clownish tracks in there too most notably the ones featuring the oboe and sound like black and white cartoon comedy background music and in no way fit the intended mood of the scenes that they haunt and quality cinematography the dialog and plot are about as complex as that of a dr sues book these actors are horrible i am actually watching this movie right now and with every word am stunned you all swallowed this shitte the only reason i didnt turn the movie off was because i have gotten wrapped up in creating an account on imdb and posting this review i dig mainstream films i dig silly stupid films i dig retro indie films and nearly any other type genre if carried out well my brother convinced me to rent this because he said he heard it was good and he generally has great taste in movies from the moment he told me the title i looked at him like he was crazy im having a tough time ending this rant because there is just so much badness to talk about the only way i can rationalize the good ratings on here is that you guys were paid to give this movie high ratings it is so poorly done and no where close to dramatic artsy complex well written well preformed or even bearable if this was the final product of my hard directorial work i would be to embarrassed to release it to the public so i dont even feel sorry for the director if he reads this what the hell were you thinking guy,negative
i feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad horror film dont waste your time or money on this film the acting is bad the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful nothing about it was good you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap the plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the end it was just so bad i dont know how a film so terrible could be made as i said before i love horror films and i was so let down it was an but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing why is all i can say just dont bother there are far more great horror films out there just dont waste your time life is too short,negative
i found it almost impossible to empathize with riccis character in this film if she was supposed to be a depressive i think the screenwriter and director neglected to research depressives before making this film because riccis character was more a depiction of a self centered worthless shtbag than a victim and survivor of depressionthe forced attempt at introspective narration was as ludicrous as the pained interactions between her and the people around her sorry but i couldnt buy it this is straight to video schlock im glad i didnt pay to see this,negative
the standard bearer of all movie serials the definite good guy flash gordon versus bad guy ming the merciless though the special effects seem awful by todays standards for they were top notch but the essence of the story is the battle between earthman flash gordon buster crabbe versus emporer ming of mongo charles middleton crabbe and middleton are terrific in their parts and the supporting characters playing dale arden dr zarkov princess aura prince barin vulcan and the rest are all very good this serial is far superior to the movie basically because crabbe is much much superior to sam j jones as flash gordonthis serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials no question about it,positive

this is one odd film it seems to be aimed at a younger audience but is filled with sexual innuendos the whole premise is rather absurd not just the idea of some shrunken heads of three dead kids doing some crime fighting but the same said kids taking on a gang of tough older guys is a little far fetched but then again the parents are mainly absent in the film and there is a lack of authority figures to keep the kids in linethe cast are good though meg foster plays a very butch mafia like leader with the handsome aj damato as the leader of the bullies aerky egan and rebecca herbst are well cast as the young lovers though for a comic actress of her talent leigh allyn baker is notoriously wasted in this filmoverall the film is unusual but i dont think that is enough to make up for the poor quality and bumbling execution the scenery is all rather dull and the special effects quite dismal sit this one out unless your in the mood,negative
manna from heaven is heavenly this is a movie for the family teens and grandparents can enjoy it together but it isnt syrupy sweet or silly the characters really are characters the plot is somewhat complex and you have to pay attention but its like putting a puzzle together as it all falls into place bit by bit the period beginning is like watching an old photo album or remembering back when its extremely well done with very accurate hairstyles and costumes the story moves along quickly with twists turns and lots of funa special treat is to watch the large cast of familiar faces many of whom we havent seen in much too long a time part of the fun is to recognize and name them mentally as they appear though this can be distracting cloris leachman by the end of the film looks as if shes had a make over on oprah i had never seen faye grant in a movie only knew her as graces mother in the tv series saving grace she was great even minus the southern accent and i didnt even recognize shelly duvall the five sisters who created this very lovely film are a very talented quintet and sister theresa is a heavenly treasure,positive
ying a chinese girl who speaks czech invited us to screening of a czech movie with english subtitles in the department of visual and environmental studies ves it was the first time i saw samotái loners and it was pretty goodmuch like in many other czech movies the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult dirty life the web indicates that this theme was popular among the us movies in the early s their relationships are breaking up combining and recombining another typical feature of the czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either also you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context thats a very realistic feature of the movies psychological analysisondej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters nevertheless you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman hanka he is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into hankas parents house a house that he repeatedly burnsmeanwhile hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents she just decides by tossing up a coin to break up with petr who works in a private radio station hanka does not view her parents bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment but she is a very flexible figure as far as the type of her boyfriends gofor a while hanka seems to have serious plans with jakub an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs however the friends from his band inform jakub that he already has another girlfriend hanka is disappointed and returns to her parentswhen hanka and petr break up it is organized by robert a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary czech people to japanese tourists robert who also provides jakub with marijuana is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women eventually his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depressionvesna a slavic word for spring who came to prague from macedonia works as a barmaid and you wont learn whether she came to czechia in order to see her dad or ufos she seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problemspetr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job a job that he eventually loses he announces to his audience that he broke up with hanka which is how ondej learns about the news that make him very happyfinally ondejs wife lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage even after ondej asks a magician to make him disappear so that ondej can try to capture hanka again the magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident jakub and hanka bring the victim to the hospital and ondej saves his life lenka also works for the travel agency as a translator and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for or so japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during hanka parents dinnerthe seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude given the actual size of the czech capital it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people but it is fun,positive
i searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging clueless perhaps alicia silverstones best known effort from early in her film career true crime has kevin dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects in fact everyone in the cast does a good job the only disappointment i think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventurealicia silverstone is pretty good in this one she carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects mary giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders i reckon her characterization of mg has some mileage in it too the inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement it could be really interesting for an older silverstone to revisit giordano at a time of crisis later in the officers life just a thoughttrue crime shows its director in a good light pat verducci also has the writing credit i dont know of any other film work pv has done i can only wonder what happened after such a promising startlike most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although bill nunn detective jerry guinn is hardly that over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances i recall seeing him recently in carriers a made for tv presentation with a military theme bill nunn played captain arends fans of the classic us tv comedy show whos the boss may also have an interest in carriers because the leading player is judith light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the showtrue crime could easily not have worked but it does ok i think it is an entertaining story worth seeing,positive

beautiful film pure cassavetes style gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress dealing with success aging lonelinessand alcoholism she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts embodied by the death spectre of a young girl acceptance of oneself of human condition though its overall difficulties is the real purpose of the film the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling its like if the stage became a way out for the heroin if all american movies could only be that top quality dealing with human relations on an adult level not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings one of the best dramas ever,positive
darkness was entertaining to some degree but it never seemed to have a plot lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment ie bad taste it started off really good with a man running from something it was very creepy for these first few minutes but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting which most of the time seemed like some friends talking to a video camera making lines up as they went that with a lack of any plot whatsoever made it look like the film was started without and ended without a script of any kind as said before gore was this films only drawing point which much of the time was hard to make out,negative
weak plot unlikely car malfunction and helpless fumbling characters at first i thought this movie was made during the seventies since the picture quality as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old kojac episode when i checked and found that it was really made as late as i was astonished this is by far one of the worst and least thriller movies i have ever seenif you read this be advised if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting like watching paint dry,negative
after world war ii the ungoing crime in phenix city alabama encouraged by the money from an army base just across the river in georgia got even worse gambling prostitution loan sharking and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city soon it was too bad and violent to even tolerate anymore this movie is based on the real story of that fightby the standards of the s it was shockingly explicit although low budget that same small budget helped with the realism requiring location shooting a very gritty film richard kiley was marvelous as always and john mcintire stolidwhy this good movie isnt on video is a real puzzle,positive
dont be fooled into thinking that this is a remake as in this years remake of the time machine is based on an earlier film its not because this is a pointless re film that is the director has used the original camera script shot for shot similar to the remake of the get away from a few years ago the scenes are identical to the original the dialogue is identical to the original the camera angles are identical no attempt whatsoever is made to embellish or restructure the original script but with a director like van sant at the helm we should be thankful he sure aint no hitchcock in fact i might even be correct in saying the costumes might be the same because the private eye wears a pork pie hat didnt they go out of fashion in the late s bottom lineavoid,negative
i saw this movie with the intention of not liking it i sure didnt its one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the oscars music throughout the film in almost every single frame almost no profanity set in a time long gone sepia toned imagery pretentious title no sex and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx cgi so that we the stupid audience get it one thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the nobel price wrong instead they call the nobel price named after an actual person called alfred nobel the noble price jesus how can one make such a mistake in such a big production supposedly based on a true story what a sham what were you and the others thinking ron,negative
a beautiful film touching profoundly up the simple yet divine aspects of humanity this movie was almost perfect and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect that is pretty good the only minor thing i subjectively object to is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story the acting is also very good and all the actors easily top actors in high profile films the actual directing seems to have been well thought through and the script must have been amazing there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the storythe moment in the movie when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn,positive
could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie sad is about all i can say this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head what an awful waste of two hours noth should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage,negative

oh it really really is ive seen films that i disliked more due to whatever reason but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making it even fails to fail at film making in a way the hercules in new york could be said to do its not the film i like the least but it is the very worst film ive ever seenthe acting is the first thing that strikes you ive never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography in fact ive plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this it really is awfultechnically its terrible the camera work is amateurish the editing is nonsensical i presume they couldnt afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and theres a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and theres a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibethe plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out ill defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythosspeaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read carmilla or at very least seen the vampire lovers im not sure how i feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel im very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material at very least the general is an insult to peter cushing thoughit gets two stars however merely because i cant bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it incidentally i watched lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to thisso in the end this is not a film so bad its good or so bad its in any way enjoyable even drunk its just a mess and worth no ones time watching,negative
this was a characters movie the plot wasnt that hot when it was there but the characters were interesting and very well acted the story focuses on the travis family in the wake of the eldest sons suicide i say that loosely because the story is mostly about the surviving son and the mother because if the father was supposed to have the story focus on him too they edited the movie pretty poorly the acting on all parts was very good particularly emile hirsch as the surviving confused son the characters were all very interesting and i didnt mind watching them until late in the film when it just seemed to drag my big complaint however was the story the son killing himself was supposed to be the center of the plot however it really wasnt it was something that happened at the start of the story but then everything went every which way then theyd mention that the son killed himself to remind you that that was the central thread the other thing was that the big plot twists of which there were plenty were never really explained or built up to but just thrown in there randomly and often from far left field in fairness the ending was very very cool but it was also clear where the inspiration for the story came from about half of it the half that wasnt padding was pretty much lifted from the story in the pearl jam song alive which reminds me there was a poem in the movie that was supposedly written by someone who killed themself i could not have been the only one who recognized that said poem was lifted word for word from that very same song i dunno this was a movie i had hope for and they really really dropped the ball,negative
i worked on this atrocity ten years ago luckily for me no one knows it because i didnt make the final cut and when i saw the movie in the theaters i was glad my agents were driven nuts by the apparently first time filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often they later told me that once back in california we shot in atlanta these professionals had hours worth of footage even edited down to minutes its at least twice as long as it needs to be i found hulk hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise what a waste of film,negative
return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character stanley returning for the sequal the film is not even worth the hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the sequals to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting ive personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first,negative
michael caton joness scottish period piece bears little connection to the sir walter scott novel of the same namethe film opens in the scottish highlands with robert roy mcgregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of his lordship james grahams cattle the scene then switches to a sword fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs adorned shirts soft colored coats paleface make up and conventional gesturesmacgregor lives under the protection of a local lord named marquis of montrose when he enters an ill advised trade agreement with montrose he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of montroses evil doers the unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape when rob roy is finally compelled to rebel against the english soldiers the action becomes well understood ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the bladeliam neeson injects heroism and passion to his character he is intelligent fair and virile he carries his height with grace as the scottish chieftain of a small community he is a loving father a passionate lover and a noble husband driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains hed rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust oscar winner jessica lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife a proud peasant woman brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat langes lines are filled with dignity and integrity i will think on you dead until my husband makes you so and then i will think on you no morejohn hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make montrose something more than a greedy marquis ruthless with money and tempered by the english courts fashion for foppery he is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service honor in his view seems a quaint notion he has two objectives ruin the reputation of his rival the duke of argyle and to hunt down the fugitive macgregor he sends his soldiers to burn the highlanders homes to kill their people and their livestocktim roththe perfect antithesis to the hero is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer he is a penniless british aristocrat a nasty hired sword wonderfully evil ravishing and murdering his way through the scottish mist his name is archibald cunningham he turns out to be a liar a thief and a murderer he dismisses himself as but a bastard abroad seeking his fortune and the favors of great men and therefore cant care about anyone else love is a dung hill and i am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow he even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girlcunningham seems pathetic he smiles foolishly and utters words with affected refinement but not terribly harmful until a muscular swordsman insults him and we discover that hes a cool head and an expert with a sword he really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a best supporting actor nominationand while brian cox is suitably odious as killearn andrew keir is montroses rival the powerful local aristocrat the duke of argyll one of the few trustworthy men mcgregor meets outside his own family set in th century scotland and with an atmospheric musical score rob roy is really a love story between a man and his wife a recognizably human story unjustly dwarfed by mel gibsons braveheart that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing english landlords,positive

i rented this type of soft core before but i can honestly say i wasnt expecting this to be in the same type as rod steele you only live until you die which was both sexy and funny it had a good script a sincere leading man and a sense of purpose it also has gabriella hall who is hot the reason why i didnt expect this movie was because the box was missing the must be to rent sticker i was looking for more cheese and less cheesecakefirst of all i think movies shouldnt be allowed to start with actors rehearsing for a part at a talent agency or wherever actors rehearse in this movies seeing the actors rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movieokay having found out that this was a soft core movie i didnt necessarily turn it off and demand my money back but the dizzying way the extended video erotic scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay cable release are very annoying and easy to fast forward through without the sustained quality of say rod steele you know they mustve had some money because i think some of it is filmed overseasi will have to say the main actor trying not to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs ive ever seen and ive seen torgo from manos it may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee that and gabriella hall still there are better corny movies to rent with your friends,negative
another film to punish us for the crime of enjoying pulp fictionif you like watching people get killed by machine gun fire for an hour and a half thisll probably fit the bill fans of the debut episode of aeon flux wherein the title character slays literally thousands of seemingly faceless soldiers single handedly will really go for itotherwise its not exactly a clever movie in fact all it is is an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people sometimes an entire scene goes by and the only thing that happens is you guessed it someone gets shot or to spice things up twenty people get shot first theyre just sitting there the next minute theyre sitting there dead yahoorough plot a young american goes to paris an american in paris get it hires a prostitute the ethereal julie delpy gets in touch with some old french buddies one of which has aids they plan and attempt a bank heist of course movie convention states that no bank robberies on film go off w o a hitch and this hitch takes up about three quarters of the running time its like dog day afternoon without the sidney lumets wit patience or humanity while at the bank things go wrong surprise and the parisian with aids goes wacko with his uzi several hundred times no spoilers here but suffice to say that youre at such an emotional distance from these characters that its not likely youll care who lives and who dies by the end of the filmsome have called it stylish perhaps it is but its someone elses style its a movie thats already been done and killing zoe is trapped by convention nowhere in the course of the movie does the director roger avary co winner of the pulp fiction screenplay oscar do anything really original stylish funky or outrageous unless you consider the fact that no movie that has taken place inside a bank has had such a high body count there isnt anything else to set this one apart from the multitude,negative
some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death i personally think that this movie is a disgust which should have never been released this movie is repulsive illogical and meaningless not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose meaning climax and resolution,negative
i saw this movie with my family and it was great this film is more than just a documentary that offers not more than cold facts with long mono duologues and lots of chartsthe complete power of this movie comes from the impressive pictures being filmed under water in the air or the arcticwith watching this movie you can learn more about our planet than with just reading a book it shows that we are embedded in the circular flow of life this movie is not only for environmental fanatics although people that want to look a good movie with a message should watch it this movie taught me that we are not only living on the earthwe live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us,positive
not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sages touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think youve seen something special,positive

tarzan and his mate was the only tarzan movie i didnt see when i was a kid it sounded boring now i have seen it i have seen the ape man about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive its a remarkable movie its almost flawless tarzan and his mate however falters its not harmonic and its parts tend to live a life of there own the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great big budget expensive tarzan himself is co starring jane dominates she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead well she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father forever the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle stupid later someone founds it in the river well its supposed to proof tarzan is dead some cheap drama the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone she takes their words for granted and want to be taken awayto england stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is how hard he is to kill the caravan is leaving and jane go along again a pothole she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband she could be smart she could dive where they found the floating bracelet check the banks for traces she can make fire in seconds and swing in lianas picking up traces shouldnt be too hard for jungle jane she could talk to the apes and so on if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with i blame myself as much as you a punishment for being vane perhaps nonsense struggle a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate still this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep just lean back and enjoy its tarzan and jane for god sake,positive

well whats wrong with the title separate lies accused elsewhere of not being exciting its cunning subtle and a bit poetic of course theres a phil collins song and a james belushi film called separate lives which are alluded to here but the real point is the ethical dilemmas of telling lies at different levels that the film probes ok its not an in your face hilarious title but then its not an in your face hilarious film please give british films like this a chance they do try to make people think about important things as here how far do you go to protect your life even if it is a bit rotten against unexpected disaster maybe you tell lies maybe you ignore your loved ones lies that can wear a lot of people out american movies on this theme are abundant but they usually go much further by involving the use of firearms which are not a part of everyday life here in europe maybe were not so exciting over here but we dont expect slogan like film titles for films that are not aimed at a massive public,positive
after all the hype i had heard about the jane austin novel and different film versions of the book i found myself very disappointed with the movie i had expected a classic drama but that was not the case first of all let me preface my review with the fact that i love old movies particularly mysteries and dramas but not female oriented movies this probably makes a huge difference so take my review with a large grain of salt i thought the acting was a bit over the top but that is very common in movies of this era june allyson was good as jo but i found every sister to be stereotypical and form driven there were no surprises or overly dramatic moments i hate writing negative reviews but the movie left me very cold it has always been my intention to read the book but after this that seem unlikely the only warming story line was between the old gentlemen and the youngest sister that was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise disappointing viewing experience again there are others who love this movie im just not one of them,negative
im kinda torn on dark angel the film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless i cant really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative so those who dont know much about bettie arent gonna know much more after watching dark angel eitherthe film basically chronicles the last few years of betties career in bondage modeling almost the entire film is comprised of re enactments of some of betties more famous photo shoots and loops these re enactments take up literally of the films run time and give virtually no insight into bettie as a person the film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much glossed over in favor of showing long and drawn out re enactment scenesdark angel isnt a horrible film theres just no substance to it the other problem is that the actress that plays bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots up close its a no go the other thing that irritated me is that although bettie did several topless modeling shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits the film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within its limitations so no gripes from me there the acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved in fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played irving klaws real name is dukey flyswatter no joke check the cast list cant say that i recommend this one too highly unless you are a true bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her and if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway,negative

yet again i appear to be the only person on planet earth who is capable of criticizing japanese films made before fires on the plain is another in the seemingly endless line of classics that get all sorts of praise for no apparently good reason as much as i love to overgeneralize and psychoanalyze all of these moviegoers who have such horrible taste in film its still nearly impossible to rationalize why anyone would ever think that poorly made fluff like this should be proclaimed as some sort of masterpiece what i find truly ironic is that fans of derivative classics like fires on the plain focus so much on inside the box movie making orthodox grading standards like scriptwriting acting camera work etc yet it always seems like the most highly revered classics are most deficient in these very standards for example one of the laziest copouts for a filmmaker involves forced verbal exposition where characters basically explain everything for the viewer even when the constructed scenario is totally artificial most surprisingly the very first scene in fires on the plain uses this indolent tactic to the extremeafter a funny head slap the following useless dialogue assaults the viewer why cant you grasp the situation we landed to the west under heavy fire to reinforce units at tacloban we lost two thirds of our men our artillery was sunk in transit we tried to reach burauen airfield by crossing the central mountains but without artillery it was impossible the enemys counterattack forced a fanout across the valley you know that so why exactly is one character telling another character something he already knows oh yeah thats right the makers of this film are too lazy to think of more natural ways to communicate this information you see a quality film would actually show these events happening or at worst it would involve dialogue involving one character who has no knowledge of those events heck even an opening summary in paragraph form directed at the viewer would have been better than what transpired heresuch instances of poor quality movie making are littered throughout fires on the plain to the point where this film feels like it was written by imbeciles for imbeciles for example the lead character stumbles upon some skeletons wrapped in japanese garb instead of doing the natural thing like oh i dont know giving a depressed mannerism the character blurts out japanese soldiers thanks buddy but i could have figured that one out for myselfeven worse this movie is saturated with over dramatic ploys the most ridiculous scene involves a pair of boots picture this a soldier walks along and finds a pair of worn out boots one would think that such a find is utterly useless but it turns out that the soldiers boots are in even worse condition so he picks up the worn boots and leaves his super worn boots behind fine i get the point the soldiers are in rough shape a fact that is already clearly emphasized with their worn boots to begin with the scene is ridiculous but i was ready to let it go until the second soldier arrives you see he finds the previous soldiers super worn boots and notices get ready cause here it comes that his boots are super duper worn boots lucky man he picks up the super worn boots and leaves his super duper worn boots behind but you see thats not all because the third soldier then arrives he finds the previous soldiers super duper worn boots and inspects them along with his own super duper worn boots since both pairs suck he tosses them both aside and smiles as he continues barefoot at this point i was ready to throw my television through my living room window the heavy handedness overdramaticism and paramount absurdity of this sequence is beyond bad film making its super duper bad film makingthere are a number of similar completely stupid moments to be had like the time when the lead character asks someone hey are you dead like the guy is going to answer yes if he actually kicked the bucket ill also be the first to condemn the subpar performance of the lead actor who is the quintessential posterchild for artificial reaction i laughed hard during that opening head slap where his head slingshot back in place with this stupid goofy expression on his facethe fact that this trivial fluff piece gets an imdb average rating of while a certifiable masterpiece like a tale of two sisters only gets a is the height of mass stupidity and to think that some people actually delude themselves into thinking that atots doesnt make sense well not every movie can have completely outrageous super duper worn boots on its side,negative
allegedly the true story of juana de castilla the eldest daughter of the catholic queen isabella yes the same who funded columbuss expedition the film charts the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband the archduke philip of austria known as the handsome and played in a rather unispired manner by italian hunk daniele liotti at his most buttery and beefy here this is a groan inducingly familiar story of late th c early th c intrigue betrayal and bodice ripping it drips destructive lust from start to finish but while la reine margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and ruthless cut throat intrigue entertaining to watch juana la loca just doesnt pull off it just ends up feeling like a big budgeted soap opera with below average lazy or over keen acting liotti looks positively bored and pilar lópez de ayala in the title role though to be fair she may mature into a proper talent just seems to be trying too hard switching back and fourth from two dimensional horny looking to spoilt teenage hysterics all the way through some of the supporting cast are ok with the exception of manuela arcuri another italian pin up voluptuous and beautiful but really no actress to speak of i couldnt in fact bring myself to feel any concern towards any character nor for that matter did i feel strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains what a waste of a substantial film budget this one sadly is just so rhetorical and deja vu nodding to other films in the genre rather than to its source material history for inspiration it seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historic era deserved a far superior film maker to evoke it,negative
i admit to a secret admiration of the original love thy neighbour tv shows mostly because they exhibit the kind of exuberant brashness and bad taste synonymous with so many programmes of their era but id be lying through my teeth very uncomfortable position if i pretended that this big screen spin off is anything other than an abomination the opening scenes of wanton vandalism are not only pointless but baffling as well its never explained why the film opens with a tracking shot of people trashing each others houses and nothing improves from there by the time the film unearths the oldest joke in the book the horrible dragon of a mother in law turns up unexpectedly to stay is followed by the crashingly obvious revelation that shes developing a soft spot for the black neighbours father moving her bigoted son to ever greater depths of self righteous ignorant rage most discerning viewers will have switched off take that as a warning unless youre keen on cheapskate spin offs with terrible acting static direction and the overall comic flair of a burning orphanage,negative
how to summarize this film it is simply impossible why you should see it maybe for the story very probably for the actors giorgio catherine above all for the universe and the poetry this is a tale sad sometimes dark but a tale i love this film just waiting for the dvd thank you mister boutonnat,positive
st watched out of dir billy wilder spectacular rendering of lindberghs famous flight by james stewart as lindbergh and director billy wilder there isnt really a whole lot of background built into this story but thats ok because wilder makes the event really remarkable as it comes directly from lindberghs perspective since he used his book as the basis of the movie this early movie about flying has to be one of the best about the act itself as well stewart talking and thinking to himself during the flight gives you so much insight into what lindbergh went thru in this hour solo flight across the atlantic and he did the whole flight without sleeping the night before which is amazing there is a little backstory about how he purchased the plane and got the financing and some flashbacks about his life during the flight but the movie is mostly about the flight the story is also beautifully made and photographed and is a joy to watch despite its age i appreciate the fact that they didnt throw in a lot of fluff and just let the story tell itself well done throughout this is a classic movie that should be viewed by all,positive
they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novakthe films co producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnates wifehepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans,positive
well well at last a view of this underrated flick but you cant find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isnt syncronized the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording overall its too dark a waist of time you should say but it isnt its a bit slow the first half part of the movie its all talking and making love to each other it is even still weird that the girls in movies from the s never wear any bras when they enter the sleeping room its full glory anyway banned in the uk since and still on the video nasties list the reason is simple its gory for their time being it really has some nasty dismemberements and its creepy in some way due the fact that it is filmed handycam way so every shot the image is moving things they do these days with the steadycam the ghastly ones could have been better if the quality of the film was better but still better then other films of the time like schoolgirls in chains,negative

this movie is an example of small budgetineffective star castweak storyline and poor entertainment this kind of movies are made for commercial breaks and not for any entertainment of die hard fans of bollywood movies i went to this movie because i thought the earlier one gangster was tolerable so this is also only thing i appreciate the way new actress put herself in the movie in a very bold way she very much resembles bollywood actress nandita das she is good sexy and acting well she definitely go up in her career our mithunda was all time good at his work atleast he has some good to the movie i didnt like imraan for his role must advise him to improve himself now as he has done many movies as new actor and he has been seen as established actor this movie has nothing except the bold scene done by new actress never try this movie,negative
i cant understand why so many peoples praised this show twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my lifenow i have seen all season episodes and seeing season episode simply i cant take this show anymore where is the proper induction in criminal investigationin season there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle can you guess why he did that he just want to identify murderer by doing this joke while mentioning supernatural ability given by tibet dream wow there are too many unnecessary scenes in this showfor example season started with a funny scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor he got the gun shoots in his belly already this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments thats allthis scene is really boring and even long min sec its like hell i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore,negative

okay here is a really short review this movie blowed i wish i could just have a review that stated this simple principle but i must bore you with more bad review type words like horrible clichéd and unwatchable its the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do heres the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play off hockey game and only van damm can stop the madness truly truly terrible but then again i didnt pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie i hate the fact he is a republican and all but then again he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage okay that is now enough space to be recognized as a review so i bid adieu,negative
youll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by stephen king dont give up your day job is the standard thing to say but thats not fair king acquits himself reasonably well hes no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most the story on the other hand is pure rubbish please give up your day jobnever have i seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actors the lead actors is probably the worst gathered together in the one film everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without expending or manifesting energy i blame screenwriter director tom holland it cant be that all the actors are really this bad what are the odds against that admittedly ive never heard of any of them before but still i dont think i could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if i tried one actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent so whats more likely that tom holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly that would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script the more direction an actor got the worse he performed you want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time okaythis theory is confirmed by the fact that holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script several writers here have commented on the fact that billy halleck is not a likeable character but thats a misleading way of putting it hes not a knowable character all we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that hes fat and that all he can think about is food all i can think about is food he tells us helpfully and in the endsigh i suppose i ought insert a spoiler warning herein the end he becomes evil why i can only shrug perhaps hes under some kind of enchantment yeah thats probably it by evil perhaps i mean inexplicable its not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means end psychology anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobodys actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audienceby the way heres my nominee for hammiest line delivery i dont think youd like it in fact big dramatic pause i dont think youd like it at all,negative
stack should have received the academy award for this performance period its a crime that he did not amazing how he humanizes a rich worthless character dorothy malone did earn a well deserved academy award for her performance in fact all of the acting in this film is excellentthe plot begins with a taxi ride then an airplane ride then keeps moving on an emotional ride that will hold your interest throughout you will be entertainedhowever this is only a blatant soap opera one dimensional percent soaper you might call it the ultimate soaper because the acting so thoroughly triumphs over the material excellently acted well directed but strictly within its soap genre i wouldnt even call it a melodrama such as mildred pierce or imitation of life while not denying the great entertainment value of this film you can only imagine what this talented cast and director might have achieved with more substantial subject matter,positive
if you want a film with the full range of emotion look no further dramatic and funny and scenes of wrenching emotion i can safely guarantee very few will be able to view this warm and very human film without shedding a tear now and then the acting by the two leads is hard to believe you would swear the two young men really do suffer from muscular dystrophy rory and cerebral palsy michael quite simply two of the finest performances i have ever seen these are two very believable characters as well and you never have the feeling things have just been tossed in for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy in the dvd release as extras they have deleted scenes including an alternate ending and an extended party sequence why these clips were not included in the final film is hard to understand as they tie in with the rest of the film perfectly and are in no way superfluous but without reservation i can heartily recommend this film to anyone one of the very best i have ever seen,positive
black water has to be one of the best australian movies ive seen in many years my girlfriend and i sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots this is as much a crocodile film as open water was a shark film in other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances how directors andrew traucki and david nerlich wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold and when i say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would i feel in that situation lead you to conclude scared witless performances were great the pacing and gorgeous cutaways to other life in the mangroves were excellent and the ending moments of the film felt very right this is a fitting feature debut for two directors who should rightfully by very proud go and watch this very beautifully shot and acted suspenseful film,positive
imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens then this goes on twice more the writing is flat and lifeless and jokes unfunny and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane,negative
the big knife a movie about the dark side of the hollywood motion picture industry is ironically far more like a filmed play than a film itself apart from a few very brief expository scenes all of the action takes place in the living room of the films hero played by jack palance hes a movie actor who wants out of his contract with his studio because of the lack of redeeming qualities in the films they put out his on again off again wife ida lupino is also fed up with the studio not to mention her husbands philandering ways unfortunately for them both the head of the studio rod steiger is a real bastard he has blackmail material to force the increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract but its only a matter of time before he pushes the man too farthis film is not i repeat not a film noir rather its an exceptionally theatrical sitting room melodrama the plot proceeds at a snails pace and is so intricate and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with the static setting and carefully contrived blocking of the actual scenes the acting is overwrought in the extreme and veers sharply between out and out histrionics and softer but no less unsubtle soliloquies that are obviously meant to be poignant but come across as pretentious twaddle especially in the hands of the woefully miscast palance aldrich was obviously going all out for a stylized something here but i doubt even he knew what it was and certainly the audience never doesi think the main lesson here is that films and plays are very different mediums what might have worked in a play did not come across as even remotely natural or plausible on film the result a big waste of time theres little to enjoy here,negative
the writer director of this film obviously doesnt know anything about film i think the dp on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun the story was awful the characters were very one dimensional for someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans that someone is kidding their self it was probably the writer director no poker fan in this world likes this movie even your money man hates this project to go into a casino and play a few hands doesnt give you the experience to write about poker keep your day job and if its playing poker then you must be hurtn,negative

becky harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously only purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls miss harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no aarp queen if these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid i want someone to clue me in absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and i literally wore out my vhs copy capturing her charms i would like to know if this movie is available on dvdthe rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention i was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent however i was disappointed on both counts god bless becky harris,negative

ive really enjoyed this adaptation of emmai have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it againthough it only lasts minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way all the characters are well portrayed most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompsons sense and sensibilityas a foreigner i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors the setting and costumes were beautiful i find this version quite on a par with the miniseries pride and prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying emma of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley not an easy part i think though he has not the charisma shown by colin firths mr darcy in pride and prejudice even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austens novels,positive

somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding us treasury agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a picky computer thief hacker doug hutchinson who stole forty two million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot deadbait marks the sophomore feature for antoine fuqua the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellentfoxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john malkovich and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost,positive
i have a completely biased point of view mainly because i live and enjoy the club culture lifestyle being a dj and frequent club goer i see the honesty within this movie and i love it if you dont know the club rave culture then it will be a great foray into that culture for anyone that doesnt know it first hand the honest portrayal of human emotion and issues in the part of jip i loved the characters were well constructed and i thoroughly enjoyed this film i really dont enjoy the fact that you have to write ten lines on this web site i will write at least or but i feel that i can portray my point with fewer than ten here are some extra lines to make the imdb gods happy,positive
i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movieexcept when the bras and bullets started flying i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyonebut the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat if im correct ralph bashki did that movie tooit involves a cat that goes through hard times with family streetsjobs etc when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man,positive
everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts oh i laughed a coupe of times but i laughed a couple of times during schindlers list also they really screwed up a good premise,negative
this movie could have been minutes long if it werent for all the bickering between son and father very predictable both male stars need a good slap in the face would you like some cheese with that whine two chucklesand a headache i can understand why the mother left her hubby after yearsi dont know how she lasted that long the first minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing i had never paid the to watch it the movie didnt flow well and was painfully long i kept watching my watch hoping time would fly fasterit didnt the script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space on a positive notethe scenery was pretty fall being my favorite season the car the ford was also quite nice this movie gets an d rating approaching an f,negative
who loves the sun works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging but often hilarious its been a while since ive found such a thoroughly touching thoroughly enjoyable film the film is gorgeous drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes the peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human very flawed and yet very likable characters due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic i recommend who loves the sun its a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness,positive
i am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is i endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it i had fun watching this movie perhaps because cat is everything i wish i could be i am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but theres are things that i really found amazing the way she manipulates people its just so divine this is a very underrated movie i lack of arguments here i usually go enjoy and then speak little about it when you go to the movies is to have fun and i really enjoyed the h i stayed in the dark room a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away lets try not be so critical about it thank you for reading,positive
i havent seen this in years but when i was about i first saw this on vhs and i must have watched it at least times now like i said its been awhile so i might screw up the plot but i remember some columbian terrorists taking a prep school hostage with demands for the head terroristthe wishmasterfather to be released from prison now i could just check the plot here on imdb but im pretty sure thats right any way a group of boys at the school decide that theyre not gonna just sit around and wait to die so they decide to fight back this film has always been stuck in my mind there are so many images that i havent forgotten like joeysi thinkdeath scene or billy spitting in the terrorists sandwiches or the one kidsno idea of his namefake asthma attack just a great film it may be films like this that have given me my tolerance for film violence because if i remember right this movie is pretty graphic guys getting mowed down by helicopter machine guns a special forces guys hand getting blown off by a grenadenot sure about that but i seem to remember something like that towards the endand the most bloody being the lead terrorist getting capped in the head in gory detail great action great humor good acting wonderful film experience ive got to watch this again after all these years,positive

watching floored by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind my god this looks like a really bad sitcom sure enough it turns out that fbl is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada poor poor canadacara shirley ng and janet natalie sky are a lesbian couple living in vancouver janet has come out to her mother already but caras parents are still in the dark about their daughters homosexuality the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from malaysia for her younger brothers wedding that same week british columbia legalizes gay marriage with janet wanting to wed cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents thats shes gay will she would she could she caras situation is contrasted with that of jesse trent millar jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen his biological father daniel andrew mcilroy is coming for a visit soon his stepfather norman michael robinson fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are harmed by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not will dialing makeover helpthe dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser s program along with the overdone physical emoting the full house style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail mcilroy millar sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with its no surprise that none impress its possible that the campiness was purposeful it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten the rewrite would focus on floored by love being a poor and ineffective send up of old sitcomswriter director desiree lim has put together a by the numbers bland fest thats entirely forgettable there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen that time is gone in this day we need quality as well,negative
this movie was made only years after the end of the civil war most likely in anticipation of the th anniversary of the end of the war in the film there are recreations of battles and the people of the era that look rather impressive and realistic it also provides a different and more balanced view than just its contemporary birth of a nation a patently absurd and racist film because of this this short film would be excellent for use in the classroom to discuss the war and tell the story of a very young man that runs away to enlist as a drummer the boy makes good and is a hero though the film ends rather melodramatically a definite convention of the day not a great film but a decent plot decent acting and little of the over the top acting you often saw in other films of the dayone annoying aspect of this film was the too frequent use of title cards to describe or set the stage for stuff that was really obvious it got annoying from time to time,positive
its been said several times not least by me that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesnt deny it but then how could he he just resents it so much so that his new movie which may also be his last inch allah is set so far back in time that its like watching woad dry those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of so that should give you some idea reality is not high on rohmers agenda so that in th century france we have at one extreme a chteau that would not be out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident one is almost tempted to say come back godard all is forgiven but even this woeful production cant make me utter those words,negative
battlestar gallactica was so great because it had tight writing a great look excellent actors and interesting stories and yeah had hot men and women running around in and out of uniformcaprica was just lazy lazy writing actors smoking up a storm to give them character outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else yes that is a ford focus sitting in the background lots and lots of teenage angst lots of gyrating naked women but in the background which im sure will be cut for the series and a token view of some men in towels none of the actors except polly walker took my attention at all at an hour and a half i was still wondering when it was going to be overso what exactly is it thats supposed to bring me back the science fiction its awfully light on that the actors besides polly walkers fine turn there isnt much interesting being done here there arent even any hotties in the cast except for maybe esai although for the younger set hes pretty old since hes over i loved bsg i was skeptical when i heard about caprica and unfortunately i think im right i predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at scifi and get to work making this more than the oc on another planet,negative
i guess every time i see one of these old movies from the s it puts me back at a simpler time no matter how corny they may seem today this movie is a good one i remember seeing it as a small kid and thinking it was the greatest movie ever it has all the heroistic characters that a young cowboy wants to be now as an adult i can look back and laugh and still feel sad but this time i actually know whats going on i did find one thing weird how many people can move to houston and hook up with sissyget marriedmove into a trailerhave a falling outcheat have an uncle diethen get back together all in the course of a month only in america,positive

someone some day should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout demon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghosts but its at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt its all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has built actually rebuilt for himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self centeredness but also it is intimated because she cant get used to the place since he remodeled it living in unaccustomed solitude real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody else a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees himthis is a good start for a melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didnt foresee or doesnt remember the movie would turn into a cat and mouse game a hunt a battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didnt expect then he would be forced to think himself out of it and maybe at the same time out of his own self imposed isolation and in a final twist would nail and maybe even kill the ernothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house the architect is just a guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the house if he is the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think hes slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks hes more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesnt get a good look but figures who else could it be not a hard question in a story with to that point fewer than three principal characters whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key i dont know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to starve i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place and this is it the architect are you ready moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the wayif this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in the architect takes up residence with martins wheelchair ridden wife unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that hes able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesnt know hes there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat burglar entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the end including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and before the story started the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses to the final long anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and thenendshere is a story that depends on the development of two things the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is and fumbles both the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel builder and sneak tenant the story should be redone by someone some day,negative
for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart this is one of his lesser films from later in his career and while it isnt a great film compared to many of his other pictures it isnt bad and is a decent time passer but not much morekim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her over time the cold and detached ms novak also begins to fall in love with stewart and apparently in the witchs rule book this is a definite no no the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches they are neither the baby sacrificing nor the all powerful variety most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps and very oddly the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz considering what i think of jazz it must really stink to be a witch in this movies worldanyway the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic but not something i would rush out to watch the acting is pretty good but the script doesnt offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film in fact i almost scored the film a it was really close,positive
i find it difficult to comprehend what makes viewers feel this is a powerful movie i would guess that the main intention of this film would be a character study and the effects of racism in a british community it is therefore all the more disappointing that all the characters are two dimensional and the acting is at the level of a college performing arts course im always sceptical of improvisation another word for being too lazy to write a decent script i was embarrassed by the performances and sat in an audience who laughed when they surely were supposed to be moved by the story racism is a serious issue but i think a subtle approach in cinema works far better than laying it on with trowel,negative
i agree with the previous comment what a disappointment rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since mira and olivier where in it i was surprised by their performance expected more since theyre good actorsthought it was a slow beginning but it got worse i even laughed at some bad stunts when is supposed to be a mystery movie you can even guess who is the killer beforehand for real what happened sorry to say but dont even bother youll waste time and moneyboring,negative
lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques some of them are very original while others are best forgottenhe depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey with so many cities lying in ruins leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration it is not a simple task as he quickly finds outhis uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles a terrible argument ensues when a passengers shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid detailsthe railway journey is like an allegory representing mans procession through life with all its trials and tribulations in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz these images horrible as they are are fleeting as in a dream each with its own terrible impact yet unconnectedat a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb in view of many by standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task quite ridiculous in fact it could only happen in a dreamits strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the traindespite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed i prefer lars von triers later films breaking the waves and the idiots the bomb scene described above really put me off perhaps im a realist,positive
i was at this films premiere at the toronto film festival in after the screening when the writer director and some cast members offered to answer questions no one could even be bothered to ask any rarely has a film been so poorly directed why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes wretchedly acted david arquette to paraphrase dorothy parker does not run the emotional gamut from a to b he parks at a and brings a lunch and utterly pointless characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions at long last the film comes to a completely random and pointless end thats supposed to really make you think unfortunately what it makes you think is well theres minutes of my life im never getting back,negative

for most people robocop is the film that really is the big disgrace for the robo series it has few fans and most people hate it for its shameless commercial pg approach now im not going to say that robocop is any good frankly it pretty much sucks but as far as being a properly shot and executed film it surpasses this piece of circuit chaos yes the truth of the matter is that robocop is the worst of two bad and unnecessary sequels to a near masterpiece so what if robocop turns robo into a cartoonish super hero in a ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy at least its doing it openly i dont know where robocop begins and ends i dont know what or whom its about i dont understand whats going on in it i dont understand which jokes are deliberate and which arent i will go insane if i try to understand the characters i see nothing of any value in anything anybody is saying i cant believe anybody looked at the shooting script and figured it would work and i cant believe that irvin kirshner saw the finished result and figured that he liked what he see he probably didnt by the way neither miller nor weller nor allen did its not hard to see whynow robocop has its fans i know this mostly they belong to this league of absolute anti pretensions dismissing anybody who expected any depth or subject matter from the first film as academic roger ebert sith apprentices its just a lot of fun a good piece of action and great entertainment the argument goes yeah well i guess if you just dont listen to what any of the characters are saying you could fool yourself that we might as well have arnold in the suit instead of weller dont get me wrong i like a good action film with pure entertainment value as its only most satisfying virtue but robocop sir aint no such thinglook at the first couple of scenes this horrible actor makes robo repeat that hes just a machine and then goes into this operatic speech about how he could never be a man where after murphys wife whos suing ocp for robot stalkings walks in out of the blue and have this sad little moment with him and then is never heard of again i surely would like to go in to this film scene by scene because every one has these kind of absurdities in them its like a twelve year old fan boy has done the screenplay the characters act totally random and first say this then say that ocp wants to stop crime with a new robo especially this drug called nuke but then it seems they really just want to become this big capitalist empire and control the entire city politics are abandoned i guess understandable given the comic relief mayor the villain played by tom noonan who did a better version of this in last action hero and thats saying a lot is an addict but is still used for this machine the woman behind it all has an agenda which is impossible to understandspeaking of twelve year olds this film has the infamous role of hub this mad kid who swears and kills people played by a child actor im not going to be all moral about it its a free world and if you want a psycho kid in your action movie go for it i dont know how much of frank millers original vision was put into this but the credits at least acknowledge him as conceiver of the story and if i zoom out i could see this as being quite a cool character its grim for sure to have a maniac killer kid but then again this is the world of robocop and who would be surprised this whole business with the ocp trying to become this giant monopoly over everything is properly dystopian and good as well also the idea of robocop getting in touch with his wife and kid having them embedded into the story somehow would also be great and as far as i can see a natural and logical step if they now had to make a robocop sequelbut of course these are just ideas as many people have already said the screenplay is mess the kid has one scene the torture scene where its hinted that he in fact is just a stereotype messed up kid and then we have this unimaginable scene where he is dying and gets all soft and friendly towards ol tin head why doesnt he just take up his uzi and try to take him down with his last breath isnt that what his character would do does he give his life a little second thought there on his death bed not necessarily given that his last words are it sucks so why it really makes no sense and this can be said about everybody no everything in this film is there a strike in the police force is robocop machine or man whats the deal with turning robo into this community service machine for minutes i mean sure its pretty funny i wouldnt deny that but why build it up and then discard it and why the hell is allen so criminally underused and what is it weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah well the threads are many and the mess is enormousthis review is just as messed up as the film the only reason i give an extra star up there is because of the actors from the first film im sure they had good intentions with it i mean its something somewhat stable some kind of anchor in this sea of bad movie making,negative
so were supposed to find it funny that this woman travels all the way to the jungle to the warzone just to find out why her fiancée didnt travel to switzerland or are we supposed to take it seriously its not even remotely funny clever or entertaining its stupid and so is the movie the lead actress is one of the most annoying characters i have ever seen in a movie even worse than jar jar binks dialog tries very hard to be funny almost all the time but it never is the number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing and as for the plot did they even once bothered to explain to us what are the rebels fighting for other than being anti government i guess that didnt matter to anyone neither to the rebels nor to the characters who just blindly flew to the battlefield dont waste your time coronado is neither funny nor entertaining,negative
im just getting the chance to dig into past austen films and i picked this up because persuasion is has been and always will be my favorite work by jane austen and anne elliot my favorite austen heroine so it was with great anticipation that i popped the disc into my playeri wasnt disappointed either i knew there were bound to be some draw backs so ill state them and try not to be too thick about them anne elliot is the most introverted of austens characters she is the least talkative and the least witty there are passages in the book where anne says nothing only her feelings are described this works fine in print but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen short of doing thoughtful voice overs which would grow tedious over four hours youre left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing and must communicate all by her facial expression this can leave the feeling that the film is slow and lacking in purpose if you need a more overt style of austen then certainly this film is not for you but if subdued is more your style and you tend to pick up on unspoken vibes this will fulfill all expectationsanne firbank as anne elliot is thankfully an actress whose face can convey much she looked as i had always imagined anne elliot would look not a knockout anne wasnt supposed to be the elegant one of the family nor in her first youth which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make up what you see is someone who is very like austens character someone whose appearance you might pass over once but hear her speak and look more closely and she grows more attractive the better you know her this is anne elliot as brought to life by anne firbankcaptain wentworths portrayal is ably handled by bryan marshall the bitterness is never apparently obvious save at the concert scene and yes i found it hard to believe he wound find louisa musgrove interesting as she was shown but that is another point of austens book he did not find her interesting he tried to find her interesting and ultimately failed sigh of relief so this too fits with austens original storyi especially liked the portrayal of lady russell who i thought in the book was not portrayed as truly bad this also comes out in this adaptationso this is one film which closely followed the book i could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced but id run out of space here charles musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters good fun mary the most annoying i was dying to have her just shut up but i had that feeling when i read the book too captains and the admiral i thought charmingthe cinematography i thought a trifle stiff there was little or practically no fade from one screen to another perhaps this is due to it being a tv movie one scene chop the next scene the actors enter from right proceed left and chop another scene where the same thing happens this was the only part of the movie which i felt cheated me a little a low budget has to show itself somewhere i supposeand as i said earlier if you like some pace to go with jane austen dont bother with this one as youll find it way too slow i enjoyed it enormously though as it brought a wealth of detail the sets were richly elegant to an excellent adaptation of my favorite austen novel i highly recommend it,positive
ive seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the sa strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this a strange jelly like substance then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctors where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger when these incidents are reported to the police they dont believe the young couple and accuse them of making all this up they finally believe them when the mass now huge turns up in the towns cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming it then attaches itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside the blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers at it and it freezes which is its weakness it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the arctic and disposed of there but it is only frozen not deadthis movie has a typical setting for its period teenagers and a small town the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughoutthe sequel beware the blob followed in and a remake came in but this is the best of the blob moviesthe cast is lead by steve mcqueen the great escapeand is the movie that made him a star and aneta corsaut plays his girlfriend im not familiar with any of the other starsthe blob is a must see for all sci fi fans fantasticrating stars out of,positive
yikes this is pretty bad the play isnt great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours especially as peploe doesnt decide how she wants to treat the materials theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that youre watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvinos central performance is breath takingly poor stage y and plummy its as if shes playing the part via helena bonham carters merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material but its hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaws ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana riggs daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertoluccis magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence,negative
jim carrey is a particular brand of humour and i personally think hes a great actor eternal sunshine for examplehowever this movie is presumably intended to be nothing more than a jim carrey vehicle so be aware straight off that if you dont think his style of comedy is funny you will sit stony faced throughout this film as it has nothing else to recommend iteven if you do like carreys comedy i am not sure you will find this film amusing i went to see it on a saturday night at pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh they giggled throughout the trailers which werent particularly funny but when it came to the film stony silence i think it raised about five genuine laughsthe problem with the movie is it doesnt know what it wants to be it cant make up its mind whether its going for slapstick or serious if it were stupid throughout it could be forgiven but im guessing its also trying to make a point about the relationship between the two central charactersthe strong point of the film is the hold ups and there was plenty of potential here but these didnt start until about halfway through and remained largely undeveloped meanwhile you have to sit through the first excruciating minutes as the couples life deterioratesfour separate groups walked out of this film while i was there and if my flatmate hadnt asked me to keep away from the house his girlfriend having just returned from a month long vacation i would have done the same and in my entire years of movie going i have done that just once before,negative
for late s cheese this really isnt so bad there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one liners that was grand theft thanks and madonna gives a fine performance nothing award worthy here but that goes for razzies as well as oscars im curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular pre british influenced speaking voice rather than the hyper bronxy accent used instead oh well as a side note i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after whos that girl,positive
the ma pa kettle characters were highly popular and controversial the films that featured their brood paved the way for television sitcoms that came after it and sought to emulate its winning formula one obvious reference is the beverly hillbillies where the new home was bought with oil money not having been won in a contest you could even say the s sitcom newhart borrows its idea of backwards rural characters from this series still i wonder if betty macdonald the washington based author who created these characters didnt do more harm than good her portrayal of hillbilly characters makes them the butt of many jokes in terms of their alleged sloppiness and laziness the real life family that macdonald based the kettles upon successfully suedclaiming they had been ridiculed and humiliated with these less than flattering references sure its comedy and the situations bring us a great many laughs and fun momentsand political correctness as we know it today did not exist in the s and s but i think macdonald couldve still written these characters more sensibly and universal international couldve had its scriptwriters show them on screen with more dignity theres such a thing as good taste the more realistic moments are when the oldest son tom is ashamed of his rural heritage but learns to accept his parents and siblings for who they are for their part the kettles have to realize that they dont exactly fit into a modern world thats not a jokethats a sober truth,positive
yeah i get pasolini and his milieu but at the same time i feel his decameron is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds crumbling architecture etc are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave in the pursuit of realism pasolini utilized many non actors but their deer in the headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off kilter and inconsistent feel and frankly many of the toothless misshapenly featured people are painful to look atand pasolinis decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content not because im prudish or homophobic im neither but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo realism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced one can almost hear him say ooh ive got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might preferthe disjointedness of the or different stories in pasolinis decameron struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neo realism he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction even the pasolinis final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter to me it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way in my opinion a far better crafted film and with more homosexual content is fellinis satyricon it is also full of bizarre looking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas decameron fails by those same elements,negative
when i saw this film it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had mostly filled with robotsi can relate to eledores problems and i have a similarity to shiro and this is a great film to watch if youre a goth who is bitter and eccentric like me all in all watch it before its out of print,positive
this is one of my favorite films for many reasons to begin there are standout performances from lovely debra paget as a princess dancing girl from michael rennie as the villain handsome young jeffrey hunter investigating crime in her city state and others the film is an unusually colorful adventure and we even see the princess rehearsing the dance she later performs for once she manages to skewer hunter before she learns he is on her side also the photography the costumes by travilla lionel newmans music and the films style are unusually fine add to this rousing action intelligent characterization and fine direction by veteran harmon jones of a gerald drayson adams script set in ad and you have the ingredients of an enjoyable grecianized near eastern but there is much to praise about the unusual and well developed storyline here as there is much more to praise other than the films swift pace well managed physical action sequences and superior technical aspects classically trained actors such as michael ansara edgar barrier wally cassell jack elam and dona drake are not commonly found in one b film together nor are there fascinating sets a variety of locales and a mystery of the quality that is supplied here one way of assessing a film is if i were guaranteed to live through the experience would i choose to undergo these events and perform these actions since my answer is a resounding yes in this case this film remains one of my choices as a favorite and very underrated cinematic work could it be that us critics all too frequent disdain for females as warriors and thinkers that as in so many other cases has caused closed minds to misprize this estimable films obvious anti tyranny and pro entertainment qualities,positive
this had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by matches the hardcore match between edge and mick foley also vince mcmahon against shaun michaels the main event between cena and triple h was a complete washout and to be honest i nearly fell asleep it was so actionless the casket match was not worthy of having the undertaker appear in it and the match between the boogie man and booker t was a complete joke if you are really a big fan of the wwe and have missed the early days of the wwf and the wrestlemanias and youll probably love this but i found that this wrestlemania left a lot to be desired,negative
i rented this movie for a few laughs i had never seen the snl skit but with hits like tommy boy and waynes world it couldnt have been that bad could it the answer it was this movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work i just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part but there wasnt any the highlight was tiffany amber thieson and thats just about it,negative
bad personal opinion the folks who made it they knew that when they made it to star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria you had to own your own goth style clothing and jewelry makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way you had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards note that i didnt say you had to do it well saves on time and paper work you had to be willing to get naked gives an r rating and thus bolsters sales want to watch a better movie easy get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself trust me you wont do any worse as vampire movies go well this one sucks and a hint here for people like me who like to look for little oddities in movies consider the link between vampires and crosses now take a look at the symbols and names on the headstones in the cemetery portions of this thing were filmed in ed wood couldnt have planned that kind of an accident any better himself,negative
this film has a powerful philosophical ending but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginningyouth alienation in the late s from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman is the obvious theme of zabriskie point neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience a fact that actually enhances the films message having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around themthis is not a script driven film except for the first ten minutes it is mostly visual with stunning cinematography the beautiful naturalistic images seem other worldly and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and dariai would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors many scenes cry out for riders on the stormeven so i like this film its different its unique it is artistic and imaginative and the desert badlands are beautifulas the years go by zabriskie point seems more and more attractive it conveys the mood of the late s in america it is amazingly artistic in a bohemian sort of way and the films last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing,positive
for a long time the menagerie was my favorite star trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by city on the edge of forever what i used to prefer about menagerie was that its more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline i still think its fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the talosians mind control abilities and captain pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy sts only two parter,positive
i really enjoyed fierce people i discovered the film by accident searching through my on demand movie lists trying to find something interesting to watch the film is mostly about class in america and it quickly grabs your attention the characters are smart and articulate and the story doesnt stick to the usual hollywood rulesthe main protagonist is finn a precocious but underprivileged year old who spends his summer with the osbourne family donald sutherland plays the patriarch ogden c osborne the seventh richest man in america diane lane plays finns mother a friend of ogden who is also a habitual cocaine user and a slut the osbournes own a large estate and seems to live by their own rules at first they seem charming and sophisticated but the super rich are different they are used to getting their own way the film is enjoyable mainly because it has crisp intelligent dialog superb acting and a story which takes unexpected turns it is also an r rated movie so its not entirely wholesome the cast is excellent anton yelchin is believable and sympathetic in the demanding role of finn sutherland and diane lane have never been better chris evans is impressive as osbournes devious grandson kristen stewart is good as the pretty grand daughter high quality movie,positive
i enjoyed this movie more than i expected it has enough action intrigue and locations to make it worth your while while i cant quite yet see mark wahlberg as a leader hes gotten good enough to be a credible manager and thats okthe superhero of the movie is the mini cooper its shown to have the speed dexterity and muscle to pull off any job and to handle a maniac driver like charlize therons character,positive
lifeforce was one of cannon films biggest flops it received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director tobe hoopers career in the wake of the spielberg poltergeist controversy all of this is unfortunate because lifeforce is actually a really great movie it is supremely entertaining moves along at a fast pace and features some of the most outrageously over the top direction production performances and special effects ever to explode across the screen it must have looked bizarre on paper the producers of the delta force the screenwriter of alien the director of the texas chainsaw massacre the composer of breakfast at tiffanys the special effects wizards of star wars audiences were not ready for this demented exercise in weirdnesswhat more do you want we got an alien spaceship full of giant bats we got a sexy naked space vampiress sucking out peoples souls we got exploding bodies we got zombies we got possession we got an sm interrogation we got the entire city of london on fire its dracula meets night of the living dead meets quartermass and the pit meets earthquake its quite possibly the single most outrageous horror sci fi comedy action disaster erotic apocalyptic epic ever unleashed that is if there are any other ones out theretry watching this movie while chemically altered perhaps then youll understand a genuinely fed up experience and one of director tobe hoopers most underrated movies maybe one day it will find its audience,positive
the mountainous woods young happy campers a warning by a park ranger and a lurking figure the ingredients are there for a horror delight and director co writer jeff lieberman does an adequate job at achieving it its formulaic woodland horror but for most part the execution is at the top the game and the story which is quite basic in a trimmed sense is effectively told in certain realism maybe a little more exposition wouldnt have gone astray but liebermans craftsmanship makes up for the materials flaws and typical details with rising tension moody visuals and a smothering atmosphere created by brad fiedels very ominously lingering score whenever that very creepy whistling was cued in it painted a truly unnerving sense that settled in with the beautiful backdrop cinematographers dean m and joel king do a striking job too theres plenty of style abound even with its minimal scope and the build up is slow grinding at times the pacing can become a stop and go affair its not particularly violent but theres still a mean streak evident even if some of it happens of screen the latter chase scenes and escalating fear is well done as it has the darkness coming alive with its burly killer s and you get actor george kennedy riding his white horse in a slight but wonderful turn theres a likable bunch of performances deborah benson makes for a strong dashing heroine gregg henry chris lemmon ralph seymour jamie rose mike kellin and katie powell round off a modest cast of believable deliveries the final climax is rather twisted but the ending is one of those types that leave you thinking is that it a well etched backwoods slasher item which probably plays it a little too safe to truly set it apart from the norm,positive
this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways everyone in my family enjoyed it the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studioone difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise cracking side kick for comedy relief and there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture the birth of spirit but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all spirit was a great breath of fresh air dont get me wrong i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so spirit is another example of great animated fare as soon as it was over my kids wanted to watch it again i had the same feeling i thoroughly recommend it,positive
i have seen this movie more than times in my life and each time i watch it the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time george berger played by treat williams leads a small group of s s era anti war hippies living at large in new york city this small group happens upon a young man claude bukowski played by john savage who has been drafted into the us army for service in vietnam despite their best efforts to dissuade him claude does eventually report for basic training in the army still distressed over his having left them the hippie group steal a car and travel across the usa to visit claude for a couple of hours in the words of george berger to an mp stationed at the entry gate of the army base claude is temporarily stationed at in nevada the outcome is truly touching so i wont spoil it for those who have not yet seen this fantastic movie the musical score is equally fantastic don dacus of the rock group chicago who plays the part of woof one of the hippies is a not a key character but the movie wouldnt have been the same without him beverly dangelo who plays sheila franklin an uptown girl who is befriended by the hippie group is sensational in her role a must see film,positive
in hoot a new kid arrives to florida from montana he first faces the usual problems of blending in and dealing with the local bully soon though he becomes aware of a bigger problem a franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the town right where a number of burrowing owls live this movie has the look of a family film but it is pretty more radical than it seems as it shows sympathetically how roy and a couple of friends do not shy away from lawbreaking including vandalism of private property and briefly kidnapping the manager of the chain of restaurants in the name of environmentalism to save owls no less now one might agree or not with those actions but at least the movie has the courage from not shying away from its convictions a good solid film all in all,positive
being a retired medical health field toiler in the vinyard i never get tired of seeing this film paddy chayefsky was a friend of my college comp teacher visited him us during several clases back in his writing ability has stood the test of time the hospital is as fresh as it was in i can watch it every week still find something new so many of the supporting cast members went unto bigger better roles in both tv film george scott made only a few comedies but his timing patter are as good as jackie gleason steve msrtin mental humour rather than physcial slapstick wins in my book every time and still a family film with only four letter word during entire film,positive
while filming an s horror movie called hot blooded the director is brutally murdered and the leading lady is scarred as she survives the attack and manages to kill murderer after all of this the production is abandoned and the stock reels are left to gather dust so a group of filmmakers decide to pick up where the film left off even though theyre warned by people to keep away from the film as the last person who was interested in the flick turned up dead in the cinema while watching the film from this its labelled as a cursed production not taking these warnings seriously the crew goes ahead with the production and they get the original star of the movie to return from hollywood to reprise her role but not as the daughter but the mother but again the murders start occurring with the cast and crew getting butchered by an unknown figure dressed up as the films killerlook what scream started hey i enjoy those films but mostly everything else that followed on afterwards were annoying and pointless excuses during this stage the sub genre came back with vengeance but it wasnt much of a good thing as they were mostly unsuccessful and unoriginal attempts where they followed the derivative pattern of the scream franchise cut which is an independent australian take on the textbook slasher genre is purely shonky garbage that lacks basically everything and shamelessly knocks off every other slasher flick but you know what i found it a cheesy delight yeah its gawd awful and highly forgettable but its a bit of ala good cheap fun while it lasted although i did hate it when i originally came across it but the second time around i knew what i was getting myself into and it worked better for it it was just like helping myself to a nice slice cheesecake again but this time it wasnt so sweetthe film came out around the same time as scream and urban legends the final cut did which all three follow the same structure of using a movie within a movie scream is obviously the strongest of the three but i would actually watch this trash over urban legends the final cut though it did seem more of a throwback to the s slashers than that of one of screams bastard offspring pretty much the film is given b grade treatment and that shows up in the script and performances the dialog is truly unimaginative and hardly comes up with any surprises and suspense while the performances are pure mockery and molly ringwald takes the crown for it she plays the wash up actress returning to finish the cursed flick and i had good fun with her laughably ridiculous send up performance she provides the bite here and nails it down perfectly the rest were mostly recognizable australian tv stars thats if youre an australian with a ravishing jessica napier leading the cast with the likes of stephen curry and frank roberts also pop singer and supposed actress kylie minogue makes a cameo appearance in the opening just to be hacked up nice these teens mostly followed the formula of horny and dim witted kids that have nothing better to do but to be killed sometimes it feels like they just waiting in queue because they have no real substance to be therethe plot starts off rather interestingly then heads into a mystery phase where red herrings pop up but then it makes a sudden u turn where it becomes a somewhat satire on the horror genre simply its rather choppy and when it comes to the explanation for all of this madness i was kind of left thinking oh my this when it tries to twist back onto itself in a clever manner but sadly it falls along way but dont you just love an opening ending also it sports some pop culture references and a self referential tongue in cheek approach predictability makes its way in rather early and the jokes can become over stated at times but it knows that by poking fun at itself quite a bit the atmosphere looses a bit of edge because of the humour taking away the bleakness but still the isolated grand old mansion where they are filming has some neat touches that added some spookiness the cinema scene is done rather nicely toonow now we know we want gore and nudity when watching this type of flick but sadly theres no nudity to be found and the gore is pretty standard if lacking but its more then decent for such low budget flick there are one or two creative deaths but the rest are systematic the killer wasnt bad but when he spoke it kind of hurt it i thought well the smart ass attitude didnt sit well with me another notes of the production which were dire ranged from the cut away editing out of place soundtrack and kimble rendalls direction lacked execution and was pretty careless but these contributing factors pull together to add some sort of sheer entertainment to all of this badnessthe imagination matches the budget thats for sure but heck this lousy slasher wasnt trying to be anything else pure schlock thats slightly amusing,negative
the only thing i knew about this film prior to seeing it was robby the robot my preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci fi flicks that the s was noted for how wrong i was big studio big budget and big production values make this a strong contender at least visually for the best sci fi film coming out of the era i qualify with the word visually because war of the worlds is a lot darker and scarier than forbidden planet and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territorywhat impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in dr morbius walter pidgeon home and laboratory but that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake the labyrinthine underground that served as the krell stronghold it appeared that krell technology was even more advanced than say that of star wars which made me consider audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in with sw or in with aliens watching it on a large screen tv in my living room offered me the same effect and im fairly resistant to hyperboleits not too much of a stretch to imagine forbidden planet as a direct antecedent of the star trek tv series gene roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in star trek i had to do a double take when the men of united planets cruiser c v headed for a transporter room while the conundrum presented to robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the st serieswhere the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of monsters from the id that morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend altaire iv was certainly a unique concept for when every other sci fi flick of the time was dealing with martians or other grotesque space creatures the film worked its subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that morbius was the protector of altaire iv some time before commander adams leslie nielsen explained ityou know looking at the calendar the year isnt that far off this movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets i think though that theyll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of robby,positive
the characters was as unoriginal it hurts the little skinny dorky computer geek the funny african american with stupid clisché punchlines cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl the actors is at best mediocre ecsept from norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy the rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table i mean why work for a living when you can rob peopleand who the f messes with the traffic lights in a major european city and in the middle of the friggin day think of all the damages and not to say deaths among innocent civilians what about all the ambulances and firetrucks i created no compassion for the main characters and weather mr wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not i could not give less of a fart,negative
house calls was an amusing comedy about a widowed doctor walter matthau who now wants to play the field but cant help but be drawn to a patient of his glenda jackson who refuses to be just another notch on his bedpost matthau likes the woman but does not really want to make the commitment that she insists upon so he agrees to date her exclusively for two weeks and then make a decision as to whether or not he wants to commit however other complications make it difficult for matthau to make a decision when the two weeks are up even though he is clearly in love with the woman matthau and jackson have surprisingly effective chemistry as a screen couple and are given strong support from richard benjamin candice azzara dick oneill and especially art carney as the inept and senile chief of staff at the hospital where matthau is employed matthau even has a brief scene with his real life son charlie who appears as jacksons son this engaging comedy still holds up pretty well after all these years if youve never seen it its worth the rental,positive

i was telling a friend of mine about the time my grandfather actually picked this horrible piece of crap for us to see one night at the theater he never picked another one again it was that bad anyway my friend then told me that her father did some of the writing for this garbage i thought she was kidding it turns out she was serious she had never actually seen it and she said that it put a quick halt to her fathers writing career i told her not to waste her time but if she did actually break down and watch it she would see within the fist minute why this ended her fathers days as a writer i mean even for the s this crap is bad beyond description i mean joe frazier as terrible tucker and why in the world would two cops care one bit about a house full of ghosts and the movie poster a ghost with his tongue hanging out what is that about nothing about this makes any sense well i told my friend that this crap not only ended her fathers writing career it ended the careers of everybody involved or at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this garbage of a movie lets just say that i will forever ridicule my friend for revealing to me that her father was a writer for this movie that alone should tell just how bad this is,negative

i recently rented this film on dvd and thought it would be an interesting choice seeing as i am both from the north of england bradford and also interested in film making however it soon became apparent that this film seemed to lack a decent level of development script wise the characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance the subject matter could be an interesting basis for a film however the delivery of this appeared naive and unfocused the ending felt as though it was casting judgement on the characters punishing and rewarding where the filmmakers felt necessary this felt a little awkward and silly and seemed at odds with the realism used in the style of shooting for me the film dealt with the characters and subject matter in a rather heavy handed and clumsy manner it felt as though the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and set about crow barring everything else in to fit itanother point that i feel strongly about is the watered down ken loach feel the film had i get quite upset that uk film financiers cant see that there is more to british films than gritty realism it has become almost a safe option film is an infinitely wonderful playground for imaginative ideas and it is not being exploited by uk feature film producers there is a lot of talent here in the uk its unfortunate that most of these individuals end up either making music videos and commercials of the time or they go to america love hate would have worked better if it had been cut down to or minutes and appeared as a one off tv drama,negative
this is one of my favorite movies of all time i loved rain man with dustin hoffman and tom cruise this movie is in some ways similar but makes rain man seem artificial shallow unemotional and trivial by comparison,positive
i obtained this little piece of scuzz on the videoasia tales of voodoo dvd label quite where the voodoo is supposed to fit in i have no idea indeed i would not usually connect voodoo with indonesia anyway let alone with wipsi know and love wip movies i have seen most of them i could not therefore resist this little known gem from the description given to it on the coverit is appalling you cannot have a wip movie if the women keep their clothes on even in the shower although it gives a nod to the exploitation genre wip without nudity is like a big mac without the beefas my gym teacher used to say on the whole id rather be at the disco,negative
you do realize that youve been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but youd think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interestingand im not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record i find questionable its just hard to suspend disbelief for bushy bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinnos with moxywhats the appeal here i dont care about these people or their meandering lives i just dont get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true habitat they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade dr frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of aqua velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear now thats entertainment,negative
this movie ive loved since i was young its excellent although it may be a bit much for the average movie watcher if one cant interpret certain subtleties in the film for example our heros name is achilles and in the final battle between him and alexander hes shot in the heel with a rocket just as achilles in mythology was shot in his heel thats a just a little fact that is kind of amusing anyway great movie good story itd be neat to see it redone with todays special effects oddly enough gary graham had average success starring in the tv show alien nation this movie is a fun watch and should be more appreciated,positive
needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dryi dont recall ever walking out on a movie before but i really tried to stay the script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly come on uma thurman doing this stuff fairly lame special effects these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny something lives just sort of annoying and wrong feelingthis review is base only on the first hour it might have gotten better i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on,negative
i went to see this movie not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the teaming of robert de niro and eddie murphy it was a fast paced movie and the hour and a half went by fast this one certainly wont win any academy awards but it was a change of pace for mr de niro he is good in comedy overall i enjoyed it,positive
i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise i left the theater with a smile on my face one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story hilarious it has some great character actors in it too mindy sterling is in it and is very good i loved her in austin powers howard hesseman is also terrific i remember him from head of the class i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made this is fun and light and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd i will definitely buy it,positive
loosely based on the james j corbett biography the roar of the crowd gentleman jim is a wonderfully breezy picture that perfectly encapsulates not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer that was corbett but also the wind of change as regards the sport of boxing circa the sthe story follows corbett a perfectly casted errol flynn from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in san fransico thru to a chance fight with an ex boxing champion that eventually leads to him fighting the fearsome heavyweight champion of the world john l sullivan beefcake personified delightfully by ward bond not all the fights are in the ring tho and its all the spin off vignettes in corbetts life that makes this a grand entertaining picture there are class issues to overcome here perfectly played out as fellow club members pay to have him knocked down a peg or two and corbett has to not only fight to get respect from his so called peers but he must also overcome his ego as it grows as briskly as his reputation does along with the quite wonderful corbett family and all their stoic humorous support corbetts journey is as enthralling as it is joyous yet as brash and as bold as he is he is a very likable character and its a character that befits the tagged moniker he got of gentleman jimthe film never sags for one moment and its a testament to director raoul walsh that although we are eagerly awaiting the final fight the outer ring goings on are keeping us firmly entertained not even the love interest sub plot hurts this picture thank you alexis smith the fight sequences stand up really well and they perfectly show just how corbett became the champ he was his brand of dancing rings round slugger fighters is now firmly placed in boxing history as the final reel rolls we all come down to earth as an after fight meeting between sullivan and corbett puts all the brutality into context and its here where humility and humbleness becomes the outright winner and as far as this viewer goesit will do for me to be sure to be sure for a truly wonderful picture,positive
i recently watched the version of this film with judy and while i appreciated the story and music i found that the film failed to hold my attention i expected the remake to be the same story except with a barbra twist i was pleasantly surprised it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame money love and the price of it all this version is so much more real than the one with arguably better music better acting a more gripping plot line and of course a deeper love i do not understand why the previous film is on the american film institutes top list while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critics list,positive
i would say this is a background movie play it the background as your tending to busy work laundry checking email etc i thought this was a film that was done before amy adams became successful after enchanted wrong it was done in the screenplay script is pretty awful i love musicals but the singing is just average and doesnt move the plot along ughh it almost seems like its a made for tv movie based on the cinematography am i watching a tv show even the secretary breaks out into song what the f is going on actually she seemed to have the best voice amy adams was so great in enchanted lead actor is average disappointed for sure this movie would have been good for lifetime but thats about it,negative
the residents are a band known for their strange appearances and odd musical stylings so obviously their music videos arent going to be exactly normal in fact these little videos are abnormal and bizarre but have a huge artistic value to them the atmosphere is built with lighting and thoughtful visuals its a great watching experiencebasically icky flix just consists of many residents music videos made for their songs the music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that sounds like its straight out of an s horror film what doesnt change is the quality of these videos theyre greatany fan of art films will love these theyre so original with their visuals and the angles they are filmed at and the lighting especially make these so interesting the music is creepy and catchy and highly original and these short films are mini classics that deserve multiple watchings this is a near perfect collection of short videosmy rating out of mins,positive

rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly griffin dunne rosanna arquette illeana douglas ethan hawke dennis hopper christopher walken and john turturro all jumped on board only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a hollywood in joke attaching martin scorseses name to this was probably the draw but the end result is way less than the sum of its parts resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong each scene seems more contrived than the next search and destroy is nothing more than abstract stylish self indulgent nonsense and the entire film is decidedly dull merk,negative
hey now i cant claim to have seen all of the films of jesse jesus franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that i have seen id say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixties early seventies and anything lately has been a bit too strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points this woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience and she seems to have this problem with dreaming the catch to whats real and whats not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isnt she seems to exist in a state of deja vu i wont say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining shots of berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere the ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black i guess no need to let you know it was over at that point my copy was from the anchor bay euro trash collection and i say give me more euro trash i cant get enough of that crap but its good crap,positive
no just no thats all that needs to be saidsummary a random guy is in a cornfield for some reason im not sure but its his duty to run around inside the next great thrillera five year old could make a better movie just filming an anthill or even just grass growing seriouslyyou cant say it has bad acting because there is no acting you cant say it has bad writing because it has no writing you cant say it has bad cinematography because there is no cinematography you cant say its a bad movie because there is no movie if you dont believe me go watch it just dont say i never warned you,negative
i have some of the older videos and dvds of dr who ive played them over and over i adore each of the doctors for different reasons but due to a man in the bbc hierarchy dr who was canceled even though it was still one of the mainstays of the bbc line up with the departure of sylvester mccoy the doctor stayed alive through the fans bbc graciously allowed fans to write books and cartoons the momentum of dr who has been steady even after then they took a chance with paul mcgann the movie was flawed but it gave the bbc an idea of what we wanted in the man was gone and the newbies at the bbc felt it was time to bring the doctor back it was a complete success here in america the sci fi channel took a chance and it has become a complete success as well although the writers were having to start over and explain the dr who mythology for new viewers it is incredible to me that they have done it in season staring christopher eccleston with russell t davis as lead writer and phil collinson as producer the doctor has come back to us and in each episode we learn more about who the doctor is the doctor who universe has always been about choice love and sacrifice this is what they provided it makes me want more and it saddens me that mr eccleston has chosen to leave the show my first doctor was doctor no jon pertwees doctor mr eccleston neednt worry about his position in the dr who universe it is as solid as the rest he is the th doctor i didnt know of mr eccleston prior to his performance in dr who but i do now i wish there was some way he could know there is push out in the dr who fan community to find his other work and enjoy it we have already seen that he is a great actor,positive
this animation tv series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works yes this is biology but they will never tell it isi truly think this is the best part of this stream of educational cartoons i do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts skin skeleton and of course organs in the same stream youll find il était une fois lhomme which relate the human history from the big bang to the th century there is il était une fois lespace as well about the space and its exploration but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future,positive
sometimes intentionally campy at other times unintentionally silly like in the opening scene where a woman is informed that she has been raped and that her family has been slaughtered just for the sake of exposition this film is ultimately neither funny enough nor competent enough as a straightforward adventure story to be really enjoyable ill leave you to decide which may be the highlight but the low point is probably the fight with a silly metallic dragon brigitte nielsen was a good choice for sonja with her fresh face and her firm slightly muscular body and i think that her dark red hair suits her perfectly but schwarzenegger gives one of his few colorless performances as calidor,negative
what happens when you give a homeless man as if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen the creators of reversal of fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experimentthey take ted a homeless man in pasadena and give him to see if he will turn his life around then with only the most cursory guidance and counseling they let him go on his merry waywhat are they trying to say money cant buy you happiness the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be or how about lift a man up its more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude they took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain thats supposed to be entertainment they dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked what happens when you take down a stop sign,negative
although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society i dont object to the extremely high salaries for many of todays entertainers and athletesa rod lebron or brady all have deals either well with figures or the low area ray romano and jerry seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows huge residuals and fees they currently demand even their cast members and all of the friends group reached near or over figures per episode lettermans earnings for one show could solve most peoples financial problems and a week or twos take care of many for lifebut all of these are based upon sound supply demand principals and the financial benefits they bring to their employers and all perform their crafts ablybut then comes along someone like rachel ray who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill i find her shrill annoying and with a forced perkiness thats as phony as the proverbial dollar billa friend of mine is responsible for special meetings events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates one of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the k level to a handful who get k and up per appearance this area includes trump seinfeld lance armstrong robin williams and no kidding larry the cable guythere are a greater number in the range list included the likes of bill cosby steve martin and even cable guy larrys benefactor jeff foxworthy this category includes rachael ray i suppose i have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her talent and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there wholl pay more than k first class air hotel suite all expenses and limos door to door for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organizations event i just cant figure how in the hell this could be possible,negative
i remember seeing this movie shown several years ago on the lifetime tv network and thought it was an interesting story several years later i see it again and fall head over heels in love with this movie the story behind the movie is fascinating in and of itself the cast just makes it that much more appealing meryl streep is definitely at the top of her game in this picture she nails mrs chamberlains mannerisms the accent and even look she shows the pain hurt surprise and anger that lindy had to endure and in the process its hard to remember that it isnt lindy in my opinion this performance of meryls was better than her oscar winning turn in sophies choice and should have garnered her her third oscar sam neill is perfect as michael chamberlain and for some surprising reason wasnt recognized by the academy with at least a nomination in all this movie only receive one oscar nod streeps for best actress however it did receive several australian oscars and nominationsdefinitely a top rate movie it tells a great story and you get great performances from the entire cast,positive
paul thomas andersons stylish and compelling take on the s porn industry follows eddie adams aka dirk diggler mark wahlberg through six years of sex drugs and disco his chance meeting with pornography director jack horner burt reynolds starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time dirks character is based on real life porn actor john holmes who like dirk was renowned for being extremely well endowed this is where dirk finds initial successthe main themes in boogie nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre pornography drugs sex betrayal violence and music boogie nights deals with the pornography theme with some control it is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal but mentally explicit when they take place on screenthroughout the film cocaine is abused enormously and the films setting los angeles reflects the popularity of the drug at that time which the film captures perfectly however boogie nights does not promote cocaine as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses for example at jacks party they find a girl who has recently and graphically overdosed blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit the film before this scenes has been fairly upbeat and comic but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occurthe music scenes are executed brilliantly from superbly staged disco scenes to a down and out dirk singing terribly in his new music career the soundtrack too is excellent featuring tunes from the emotions elo the beach boys and the unforgettable sound experience the standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music dirk redd rothchild john c reilly and todd parker thomas jane visit drug dealer rahad jacksons alfred molina house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs but night rangers sister christian which is playing in the background increases the intensity of the scene incredibly proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene boogie nights is filled with those kind of scenes which makes the film even more fantasticthe standout performance in boogie nights is burt reynolds as the enigmatic yet moody film director in the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies it is a complete shock for the audience because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content other notable performances are julianne moore heather graham as the beautiful rollergirl john c reilly and mark wahlberg who delivers the performance of his careerboogie nights is also a surprisingly original film using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way andersons approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong or at least until the s arrive from then on things turn very dark indeed and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone this does not however reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offersboogie nights was not a box office success earning only million at cinemas in the uk but this is not the films or the directors concern anderson recognises quality not popularity which is evident in his three other films hard eight magnolia and punch drunk love i would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations because at the end of this film you will realize that boogie nights is a simple morality tale but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it boogie nights is at once shocking hilarious devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding,positive
i recently watched this again and theres another version which is shorter i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the differenceone is japanese and no pikachu short is all i can come up with ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice prof ivy was rather boring she sounded as if she was almost asleep no expression at all with the few lines she hadthis was enjoyable enough but there wasnt much to it at all a collector whos after lugia he has no plan to destroy the world and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture lugia causes a lot of destructionthe pokemon movies that follow are slightly better deoxys poke is great with no almost here,negative
its always interesting to catch a line in a film that winds up being somewhat prophetic for the future of an actor in this case i was intrigued by edward g robinsons statement to barbara stanwyck i promised you the valley as he discusses the lone hold outs to his attempt to control all the land in logasa ten years later stanwyck would star as the matriarch of the barkley family on the big valley somehow i thought she might have looked older in the earlier picture i guess all those bright gowns and fancy riding outfits have a way of bringing out ones youthful sideas for my summary line above thats lee wilkisons appraisal of john parrish glenn ford one of those hold outs mentioned earlier shortly after parrish uses his knowledge of military tactics to take out a number of wilkison hands after they raid his ranch and torch his home i liked the way the film explored his character starting with the way he dealt with foreman wade matlock richard jaeckel in a calculated showdown the set up for the ambush was also a clever maneuver diametrically opposed to the strategy of rushing the bad guys head on with both sides fighting it out to the last man standing for that parrish also had something to say never meet the enemy on his termsthe violent men is a good title for this film and was probably at the head of its class in the mid s though by todays standards doesnt come close to the blood letting one will find in a tombstone or open range where the bullets exact a nasty savagery but its shaped by fine performances from the principals with a sub plot exploring infidelity that seemed almost ironic considering it was stanwycks character who was cheating,positive
i will probably always go to see a woody alleb movie as one never knows when he just might make a real return to his past greatness just one or two great moments or lines could make it worthwhile sadly however this film just doesnt make it on any score saying thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty im sure my reaction is much like a lot of other fans of woody but what can one say its probably time for him to concentrate on his clarinett which in my opinion he is rather quite good saying all of this ill still probably go to any new film woody may come out with in the future theres always hope and ill continue to love and respect the woody,negative
i normally dont comment on movies on imdb but in this case i feel like i should i love movies and i want to make them and this movie is a perfect example of fine filmmakingthis is one of the few movies that i have seen on the small screen originally seeing it air on amc i believe and then on the dvd i just watched that made me get that feeling in the pit of my stomach that little gnawing sensation that the director would hope you feel while watching his thrillerjack lemmons performance is a fine one and jane fonda and michael douglas follow i felt so much empathy of lemmon whos character jack godell only wanted people to listen to his warningbut what impresses me most about this film is the lack of a score and this is also what makes it beautiful to me apart from the opening titles there are no background music to increase the tension because none is needed and while the credits run white on black in silence it drives the point homei use the movie as an example to anyone who says music makes the movie i think the movie should make the movie and the music should only amplify that but for the china syndrome music is not necessary to get across the realism and the urgency depicted here the characters portray all of this far better than the music ever couldi highly recommend this movie it is one of my favorites if you like movies you wont be disappointed if you like movie soundtracks more you might not want to give this one a go,positive
i might have given this movie a higher rating before peter jacksons trilogy came out but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison the pace of this movie is rushed many important scenes from the book are left out and there is little character development the animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over which i found distracting and the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished there are some good points the battle scenes are exciting to watch and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter watch this one if youre in a hurry and cant spend hours watching the new trilogy but if you havent read the book youll probably be confused because there is a lot missing from this version out of,negative
this may have been based on historical events and we know that the makers of this tv docu drama took liberties to make it more dramatic i can live with that but it was just so badly done i was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid air crisis how calm everyone seemed surely someone would have panicked and what a smooth flight no passenger discomfort apparent come on not sure about the regulations nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems ott nonsense but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing common sense tells me this is not a good idea the shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake in reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors yet nobody appeared to exit from the front even though the drop was much less the captain went back into the plane after the landing why this was never explained we know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible as i am sure i would have done there were just too many inconsistencies errors and faked action in this i would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed it had the potential to be quite thrilling but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing but no real danger the reality of course being somewhat different,negative
hollywood north is a satirical look at the time in canadian film history when the canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in canada most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get american films made for example porkys came out of it anyways matthew modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved canadian novel however in order to get the money he needs a american name star he gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on it plays well in canada but may not be understood outside of the great white north americans will think were satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that were actually satirizing them for canadians for the rest of the world,positive
a fare to remember is a totally derivative almost ridiculous movie but has a warmth about it that makes it a very effective and upbeat holiday movie it stars a pretty newcomer challen kates as a high powered ad executive who right before her wedding has to rush from la to seattle to keep a client who has rejected every other presentation she has transportation difficulties from the beginning and seemingly no money this is the first dumb thing were there no atms anywhere she must make a fortune at any rate she meets a cab driver warner who looks like a homeless man and he drives her to her presentation and when she emerges with a huge box of beef jerky the clients product hes there to take her to the airport all flights are canceled so in order to get to la for her wedding she hires him to take her therealong the way they bond and learn from each other its a very sweet movie though there is absolutely nothing new in it it combines six days and seven nights and a few other films but the chemistry between the stars is good theyre likable and the acting is good look for jerry springer as the head of the beef jerky company and a cameo by karl maldenthis is a nice film to take in over the holiday season its on lifetime,positive
terry gilliam traveled again to the future he had already done it in brazil to tell this story about a virus thats destroying the human racethe script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but its quite entertaining and gilliam proves that hes got imagination the futuristic scenes are just great as for the cast bruce willis and the beautiful madeleine stowe whatever happened to her are just ok but brad pitt is so annoying whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and hes not credible at all he should just play good looking successful young menmy rate,positive
it may or may not be considered interesting that the only reason i really checked out this movie in the first place was because i wanted to see the performance of the man who beat out humphrey bogart in his casablanca role for the best actor oscar i still would have given the oscar to bogie but paul lukas did do a great job and deserved the nomination at least well im glad i did check this movie out because i enjoyed it immensely i think the movie did preach a little but not only did i not mind i enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with themthe acting was outstanding in this movie i especially enjoyed paul lukas lucile watson rightfully nominated for an oscar bette davis wrongfully not nominated george coulouris and oddly eric roberts who plays the middle child i really enjoyed his character an odd looking boy who talks like some sort of philosopher he just cracks me up even the characters name bodo is funny the ending in which lukass character was forced to do something he considered wrong even though he was doing it for all the right reasons worked for me as well i agreed with why he felt he had to what he did and i understood why he couldnt quite explain it the message this movie makes is a good and noble one the scenery meaning the house is beautiful and the acting is the excellent watch this movie if you ever get a chance,positive
not the best of the films to be watched nowadays i read a lot of reviews about shining and was expecting it to be very good but this movie disappointed me the sound and environment was good but there was no story here not was there a single moment of fright i expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller the only scene where i got scared was during the chapter change scene showing wednesday there are lots of fragments i the movie most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything the story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown might be a good movie to watch in the s but not for the st century,negative
you must be kidding lets entertain the possibility that parker posey is really an actress and not just some entry in the quirk of the month club of actors really unless this is meant to be a tongue in cheek satire on david mamet terse confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone think ben stein blandness or a flat out dry comedy this film has got to be in the running for a rotten tomato award or worseas if the stiff and uncomfortable posey werent enough weve got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable jeff goldblum theres more wood in this film than a toothpick factoryadding to this already bizarre casting are several other roles all populated by forgettable actors who look or sound like escapees from americas next top model don pardo or even the kid who pronounces the word been like bean which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film we are analyzing his accent to guess if hes canadian or not i think i laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of alarik jans music for mamets the house of games if taken as a spoof the film is almost droll if taken seriously just a self conscious piece of drek,negative
this movie had a very unique effect on me it stalled my realization that this movie really sucks it is disguised as a thinkers film in the likes of memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious crp probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks the whole idea is i dont even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind a very weak one btw with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and confess what how what why why is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water forgot about cooking it i guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of why was this happening you have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts lie solving riddle rhymes start to have an abnormal effect on people acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store yeah theyre all real though s o bs the menacing atmosphere with the oh so clever riddles enter the s series of batman and robin with guest appearance of the riddle and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their faces just horrible horribleim usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it,negative
im a sucker for mob gangland movies so i rented this movie this movie is a complete train wreck with all the big name actors in this film i can not believe how bad it was it was so bad that i began laughing hysterically towards the end of the film the actor better known as zues or the big dude from the ice cube movie friday does an incredible overacting job throughout the film first thing i told blockbuster when i returned the film was to remove this garbage from their shelves do not rent this movie unless you want to waste two hours of your life if they come out with a sequel i wonder if it will be twice as bad as the first i will be more cautious when renting so called mob gangland movies,negative
this movie possesses something most other movies of its genre do not intelligence and good messages accepted is the story of a kid named bartleby justin long who gets rejected by every college he applies to his parents are incredibly strict frustrated and disappointed so bartleby and a few other students who face similar problems start a fake college to pawn themselves off to their parents as college kids not everything goes to plan and the movie is about them winging it but behind this plot which sounds ridiculous there are good messages morals and a new outlook on the american educational system the college they create south harmon institute of technology accepts those who did not get accepted anywhere else the message is that you do not need money tradition or fancy books you just need a desire to better yourself they are a completely unorthodox school but what the movie teaches is that thats still ok and different whether its a person or a school is not necessarily bad and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves despite whether they are weird its a message of non comformity and has traces of anti authority sprinkled in as well but not only are messages great its hilarious haha i laughed very hard the humor can be subtle but can also be blatant as well and is a great mix fraternities beware,positive
dont get me wrong i love david suchet as poirot i love the series as well as the movies but enough already re death on the nile everyone has done this one we know who dies we know why they die we know who the killer is we know how it was done so i say enough already mr suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of agatha christies novels i will say that the acting by all the actors was superb the sets were terrific and very realistic i especially liked david soul but i was surprised at how awful he looked i hope he doesnt look that way in real life i honestly cant remember from other movies whether the very end was the same somehow i dont think so i thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not ms christie wrote it that way i would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison,negative

not only does the films author steven greenstreet obviously idolize michael moore but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of moores propaganda film making tactics moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though while greenstreet is obviously less skilled herehaving been privy to all of the issues surrounding moores speech at uvsc i was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community that moore was being paid of the state of utah s educational funds to basically promote john kerrys campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie were pushed to the background by greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalizedthe marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable promoting the film by claiming that mormons tried to kill moore not only is this preposterous but it defames a major religion that greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with i followed moores visit very closely and all of the major news agencies noted that moores visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in utahgreenstreet has banked on this film to jump start his film making career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this this seems to have been a severe miscalculation though since moores visits to roughly other colleges and universities across the country in diluted interest for this rather common event greenstreets assumption that american audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesnt seem to be well foundedeven the name of the film this divided state is somewhat of a misnomer since utah voted overwhelmingly for bushs re election and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other state the division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in greenstreets ideological differences with his religion and state if anything i find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and woody allens hilarious contention in sleeper that i was beaten up by quakers,negative
strangeland seems to have a love hate relationship with many of its viewers i personally loved the movie and everything about itthe acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting cant in some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late s over all dee did an amazing job in writing what i believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers ive ever seen it plays on the fears of many age groups adult parents and children every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet and it does happen in the real world and every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for manymy only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie if you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed,positive
hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again take superheroes for example for each x man and spiderman there are daredevil elektra ghost rider and hulk japanese horror remakes are even worst it only took the ring which was pitch perfect mostly because of mr gore verbinsky to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors eg the ring the eye dark water which was fine but pointless and the grudgesthe first grudge wasnt entirely bad it was scary most of the way which is what one could expect from it plus the plot had some brains mixing narratives grudge is exactly like the previous this could be a good thing but hey what boy men in black ii was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain for the grudge the critic goes the same waytired scares bad acting except for amber tamblyn and clichés all over the place three stories take place on different places and time there is aubrey tamblyn investigating what drove her sister karen sarah michelle gellar to death allison arielle kebbel who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place and finally an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door glad to say and i mean it that everything is tied up at the end but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture when everything else is simply tiresome and dullthe chills are all over there a girl alone in the lockers someone who shouldnt enter a house others that dig too deep meanwhile ghosts keep killing and killing and killing which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic hey doesnt that seem just like another bad japanese remake something called pulse yeah day after day its getting easier to hold a grudge against hollywood bullshits,negative
i wouldnt say this is a bad movie unfortunately for me i get the feeling that the more you know about fencing the worse it gets simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic ive been fencing since i was years old and this movie portrays it very poorly f murray abraham is good and appears to have some fencing background but most of the other actors especially the students just seem to be lost,negative
coen brothers wannabe from writer director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other better movies yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist ha ha who goes on a killing spree in the desert the film is unusual but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience it becomes alienating and off putting with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating an admittedly bravura finale many quirky bits of business and forster looking great in the nude make this a curiosity item nothing more veteran movie director irvin kershner produced and maybe should directed as well could paul chart be a pseudonym from,negative

first of all im upset theres no choice of a out of i was bored tonight and while flipping through the channels i see dr chopper with there being nothing else on i decide to watch it expecting it to be just another crappy horror movie with a similar plot to cabin fever man was i wrongdr chopper made cabin fever look like it should have won numerous academy awards may i remind you cabin fever contains a scene of a little hick boy doing roundhouse kicks off of a porch screaming pancakes characters who leave their dying friend in a tiny shack to bleed to death and shawn from boy meets world mistakenly fingering a hole in a girls thighso needless to say dr chopper was a big smelly pile o crap it wasnt even funny crap it reminded me of a horror movie i had to make in th grade called the campout except for the fact that the campout had a better script we wrote it about an hour before filming better actors plots bloody scenes and camera work i was hoping to get some laughs out of a poorly made horror film but instead i could only watch in astonishment as i thought to myself was this made by th graders the acting was horrible the events and different little subplots were thrown together and didnt make sense and the gore and violence was very minimal i liked how that from a small stab wound people died instantly and the only weapons the killers had were small pocket knivesif youre going to make a horror movie at least give the killers an insane killing devicealso what the hell was the point of the sorority girls hazing their pledges good way to bring in some scenes of girls running around in their bras even if they have no relevance to the story whatsoever and i must say my favorite line was when the blonde says to dr chopper id like to introduce you to someonemy inner bitch her inner bitch then proceeds to grab a garbage can throw it at dr chopper miss and back up in terror of the killerwhewwwell that was a long one but i felt that i needed to express my feelings on how absolutely horrible this movie was i know that everyone has their own opinions but if anyone rates this movie higher than a they should be shot to hellseriously,negative
had it not been for to kill a mockingbird this movie would be much more famous had it not been for gregory peck as addicus fitch the acting here would be much more lauded had it not been for william faulkner perhaps to kill a mockingbird might never have been written in his shadowi found this movie to be sadly familiar because it showed me that one of my favorite movies to kill a mockingbird may not have been as original as id always thought it was perhaps it was inspired by this very similar movie oh the whodunnit is different but the underlying story a lone righteous white attorney against a white southern town defending a black man is all too familiar and written by a woman mockingbird concentrates on rape the ultimate betrayal to a woman while this movie concentrates on brother against brother hatred the rape a man feels by fraternal betrayaltheres not the depth of mockingbird here not the comfort that addicus brings with his presence so youre just left with the sadness that whether she intended to lift the plot from this movie or not harper lees mockingbird reflects nothing changed in that or so years since the time she may have read faulkners book and saw his movie while in college in alabama and unconsciously or not took most of it as her own in later years nothing changed in race relations and some may say nothing has changed even now these many years laterits all too sadly familiar and one wishes there were an addicus of our day to make it all right where mockingbird leaves you with hope of that rocking in the arms of addicus and waiting for a morning of better times this movie leaves you just sad that pride from black people might equal or better the pride of white people but pride from either is no answer at allrather its the answer of addicus we need comfort that we are all flawed and that in our frailty we should have mercy not pride when facing each other in our differences,positive
wow its ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days agoanyways i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl for the recordthe movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so cliché and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists toothere is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower well actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho a good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and dont watch it,negative
unfortunately this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so its complete rubbish acting as another member said this movie is a good example of how not to act i havent seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time the actors can you call them actors are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is you would have to see the movie but that would be akin to torturei cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines and the rest of the cast with their accents fake or contrived is equally heinous another actress with the fake british accent was pretty yes but good lord was her accent terrible mix that with her lack of acting and you have a disaster she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl oh my we just got to the scene where the leading ladys lover says really me after a forced crying scene from her laughable no really i just laughed out loudthe sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice minus the actorsthe old magic potion lady what another member mentioned the modern love song that was in the movie totally inappropriate for a period piece set some years agoi understand the movie was considered big budget in thailand at the time of its production i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good or even mediocre filmi would give the king maker a out of but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating out of,negative
this movie tries hard but completely lacks the fun of the s tv series that i am sure people do remember with fondness although i am i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun sadly this movie does little justice to the seriesthe special effects are rather substandard and this wasnt helped by the flat camera work the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour other films with under par scripting are home alone cat in the hat thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunionnow i will say i liked the idea of the story but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy and i was annoyed by the talking suit despite spirited voice work from wayne knightbut the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd jeff daniels and daryl hannah all very talented actors jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before but he didnt seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing and elizabeth hurleys character sadly came across as useless daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored and i liked the idea of her being the love interest but sadly you see very little of hernot to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative christopher lloyd acquits himself better and as an actor i like lloyd a lothe was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit and i am fond of back to the future but he was given little to work with and had a tendency to overact quite wildlyoverall as much i wanted to like this movie i was left unimpressed instead of being fun it came across as pointless and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential with some talented actors and a good idea but wasted with poor execution bethany cox,negative
if this is all the watchowskis have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning beautiful is story wise cliched ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans all too eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance doesnt that make the machines the good guys the machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans who reject them in favor of all out war which the cleverer machines naturally win if this is the back story then we shouldnt be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate since i do not believe that the watchowskis intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt creating a back story,negative

ann margret did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making i felt as if she was mrs frey there might be one or two films of ann margrets i have not seen since her film debut in pocket full of miracles with betty davis in i feel she has been totally under rated in the industry though she was nominated for an emmy award for this role in who will love my children she was overlooked like she was nominated for an academy award for her roles in carnal knowledge and tommy she was snubbed over all i think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in who will love my children yes it is a sad movie as true stories can be but well worth the time thank you,positive
just saw it yesterday in the sao paulo intl film festival just before going i came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was a pretty nice rateafter minutes i was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screeningi did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of siemens and organics advertising on the movie despite the fact that i already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself i still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and siemens mobile popping up all the time on her lap top or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen all of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad a dont know how to do sex in the citydont waste your time or money,negative
a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother saving grace seems cut from the same cloth as a half dozen other british comedies over the past two yearsunderdog is faced with adversity finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him herself in the processwidowed and thus broke grace is a master gardener and is enlisted to help her friend employee matthew grow his pot plant hes been doing it all wrong so grace helps him out they realize that she is the perfect person to harvest pot which they can both benefit from he enjoys smoking she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her merchandise dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in saturday night fever and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb blethyn is always watchable and you cant say that about a lot of peoplewell i cant anyway ferguson is very good and tcheky karyo who i liked in la femme nikita is memorable not profoundly moving or insightful but immensely entertaining and at a brisk minutes feels like a walk with friends,positive
for many and many years gaijin have visited japan for learning martial arts instead of acquiring any knowledge on it gainjin have been told only nihonjin could achieve the excelent performance required to show some techniques in a public performance such as a moviethis one special movie made by sho kosugi not only shows all of those techniques and skills but also teaches many and many lessons on how to achieve them and one can verify that by seeing a lucinda dickey performing fantastic and unforgettable acting skills in ninjutsui strongly recommend watching this movie more than thrice because three times is not enough to seek out hints and tips given so easily by sho kosugi to those who really seek knowledge itself the gnosis,positive
the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross cultural insight the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way there obviously are mud brick villages dirt tracks in the middle of the desert women clad in black robes and belly dancers i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible the original idea might have been interesting but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight you should skip this movie,negative
this is unlike any other movie the closest thing i can compare it to is a woody allen film but where as woody allen is constantly fathoming human foibles bret carr appears to be trying to figure out a way to get to grips with that one crippling insecurity that tends to define us for better or worse in the case of lou it is the root cause of his stuttering which can be traced back to a singular child hood trauma that is revealed through flash backsthere are so many strangely neurotic people in the world and i believe they all deserve a chance for redemption although diversity of human character is after all what makes the world such an intriguing place so maybe we shouldnt fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our noses or breaststhis is an indie film shot on a long shoestring but the production values are tremendous as is the scope of the film i feel like its a quirky gem for the self help market i really look forward to seeing what this filmmaker does next i could imagine a career along the lines of woody allen or albert brooks although usually when a guy like this breaks through he goes off and makes x men and his humble quirky origins are soon forgotten or are they x men is aout a bunch of freaks if i remember correctly,positive

this cosy middle class sitcom became the subject of much hatred by the new breed of talented comedians in the s such as ben elton did it deserve such malice well terry and june was never clever it was never a well written tale with different threads which intersect at the conclusion it was the show your mother and father and probably grandparents watched they chuckled rather than laughed but they were never likely to be offended by the show so the fact that it never challenged them was immaterialone foot in the grave suffered initially because it appeared at first sight to be just another terry and junea few days after the death of terry scott an episode was broadcast on terrestrial tv and that has been its final outing there have been few repeats of the show on any tv channelthankfully tv comedy has advanced since terry and june its hard to find kind words for it terry scott did make the best of weak scripts,negative

stories of the century was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the television season it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award starring veteran western actor jim davis as railroad detective matt clark the series set clark and his fellow railroad detective partners mary castle as frankie adams for the first half of the season and kristine miller as jonesy during the second halfagainst historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid s to the early s the series was very satisfying easy to watch and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of jim davis in the lead role he seemed like an actual western character one other note when matt clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dusta very good early adult western,positive
it may be a little creaky now and it certainly can never have the impact it once had but this is still a thrilling reminder of what michael jackson could once do looking back on it now for the first time since its initial prominence i was struck not by the horror trappings quaint but fun and vincent price has never sounded so genuinely un camply sic menacing than its absorption of the horror film allowing jackson behind genre and make up to give us a bravely revealing portrait of male sexualitybecause thriller isnt really about horror in the way horror isnt really about horror it is about that age old theme the sexual awakening of a young woman the film opens in a cinema with jacksons girlfriend uncomfortable with the imagery and the aggressively gendered response of course she is on a date and she is less scared by the film than what she knows will be expected by her boyfriendthe mainstream imagery of the film they watch the group atmosphere all suggest the socially conditioned expectations this leads her not only to think of the body in disgust hence all the decaying ghouls the loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death but the sexual rite is not just about her boyfriend but her peers her society hence its visualisation as a gang violationthis is brilliant disturbing stuff the best thing director landis has ever done jackson the most popular artist on the planet was still willing to show that the fixed image of a star contained multitudes not all of them reassuring the song itself has held up remarkably well the creepy insistent bass rhythms the extraordinarily salacious lyrics the beautiful s disco ecstasy tailing the chorus shattering timelessness revealing the milky desire behind the fear,positive
i was very surprised how bad this movie was nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far i was hoping for a rerun of hero but this is much much worsethis movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place no believable characters even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies these characters are ridiculous virtually no plot and ridiculous story twiststhis movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child every time you think your silly battle makes some sense they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense ah ha you only think youve got me with your super powers and ray guns but i ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon so your ray guns dont work and im invulnerable to your super powerstap tap no trade backs infinity plus one children can continue with this lunacy because they dont really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time however for the viewer especially the adult viewer this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gasspoilers ahead note to kung fu movie makers a if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on pcp in which case your kung fu is not strong b if you repeatedly fall on your back which has a knife in it it will hurt more and do more damage unless it is a fake prop c when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife you die especially in ancient china where there isnt a kaiser permanente around the corner d kung fu fights dont last for hours while feet of snow falls and e sometimes it is worth while explaining your characters and their motivationsin any event go watch hero again because at least within its own little world it is comprehensible,negative
this is truly abysmal i just got a copy of disco beaver from outer space after hearing good things about it and i have to say this was just so incredibly unfunny and bad it will leave you numb and mystified how this ever got madei mean what was it is it that this is typical late s humor i dont think so this is just so bad and believe me i dont mean so bad its good either this is a collection of extremely unfunny skits as if you are watching cable tv sure enough this was an hbo program and to think this may have been considered groundbreaking is scarythere is one somewhat pretty girl in it and there is some old nhl footage of the ny islanders hockey team which is fun to see even though i am a lifelong ny rangers fan but they even mess that up as they try to get some humor out of two hockey players scuffling on the ice as if they are dancing and even worse reverse the videotape of two hockey players fighting to make it look like they are having sex oh how funny in one slight bit of cleverness there is an interview a hockey player named chico who resembles ny islander goalie chico resch but they even blow this by having him wear a rangers jersey well maybe that was intentional who knowsthe bottom line is disco beaver is just so blatantly horrible so unbelievably bad you will definitely feel cheated after watching this and wasting almost an hour of your life youll wonder what possibly made the makers of this garbage think they had something funny here and youll also wonder why these skits cant even come close to the worst saturday night night slop incredible just incredible,negative
very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas cant say much about this film without giving away the story i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture everybody has his or her own agenda nice little surprise at the end after all the other surprises well written with good performances by all,positive
ok where do i start i saw a screening a couple weeks ago and i was shocked how bad this movie is sure if you just love beverly hillbillies and green acres bad acting and you think they are the best tv shows on air then you will definitely love this movie me personally i really like georges work and he is very talented but comedy is not his forte some people are natural in comedy and i am sure he is great funny to work with personally but comedy he can not pull it off on the big screen it was a cute movie but would i pay to see it hll no now that i have seen it i would not recommend it to anyone to spend their money george buddy i love you but please dont do any more comedies this script is lacking a lot great concept but just didnt do it,negative
i think that this is one of my top ten worst movies i have ever seen theres like fade out every two minutes if this was on tv they would have a preview every minutes but there is a seen i personally enjoyed which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about seconds you see her whole body with no towel on that was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last minutes is when we see his whole body plus most of the deaths are off screen and just the scream or roar and i was expecting the sasquatch to die but he dosent shoot him and only or people die in the whole film i was expecting people to die dont watch this movie i give it an f dont waste your time,negative
this is the only christopher guest movie that rivals spinal tap and princess bride for sheer entertainment value but somehow never gets near the recognition the plot surrounds the contestants dogs and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dogok its about a dog show the owners truly are characters as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs thats really all there is to it but that makes it funny enoughyoud never be able to convince me that a mock u mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where levy and ohara visit larry millers house on tvbut thats really all it takes to convert any doubters spinal tap was non stop hilarity joke after joke whereas best in show was had a few more lulls and by that i mean say minute at most where something riotously funny doesnt happen but the big laughs are even biggerthe casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in uh movies in general parker posey does a fine job in fact her tirade directed at ed begley jr and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the filmwhats amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot simple as it was around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction i guess theres a freedom in having such a minimal plot everyones role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over the top the realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than mighty wind or the uneven guffman i actually encounter wierdos like this now and then if you like guests stuff at all you should definitely own this one,positive
film noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact cleverness intellect and imagery this movie has none of that though they really tried hard with the imageryits the kind of movie that your cousin marky the dump truck driver whos always talking about how hes going to make it big in the movies someday would makethe dialogue is wooden and lifeless the visuals while obviously expensive to make are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and failed miserably due to a severe lack in cerebral ability the acting ranged from sub par to just plain bad the story might have been salvaged by a real writer and director but i suspect that such people would not have touched it with a barge poleabout of the way through i noticed striking similarities with the scene in simne where viktor desperate to be rid of his actress makes the worlds worst movie i figured id check imdb to see if a similar effect has occurred in this movie and to my surprise it has id almost be tempted to give a out of just because its exposed the pretentious groupies but i wont its that bad,negative

a friend clearly with no taste or class suggested i take a look at the work of ron atkins if this is representative of his oeuvre i never want to see anything else by him it is amateurish self indulgent criminally shoddy and self indulgent rubbish the whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers there is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangmans noose the lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless i saw a doco on american exploitation filmmakers during the recent fangoria convention atkins was one of those featured he spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this i see nothing of any import whatsoever there is no style either and the horrible video effects like solarization only enhance the amateurishness not even so bad its fun avoid,negative
great mystery but the film goes down hill from there the beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer edward he is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills a mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter so ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman they dont like outsiders a lot of filler is with ed shown looking around town for the girl that made the movie too long it finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for edwardoverall not a well written story and too long final verdict i would skip this,negative
i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it however i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type however just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that,negative

with no fault to the actors they all put on great performances the overall story was not very well executed the movie opens with a great zinger a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girls car off the road but then were forced to endure minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters and we dont know why until the minutes are up it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girls body and the story progresses from therewhile the story does pick up at that point it really goes nowhere after hours i asked myself was there a point to this or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished while it is well acted theres not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it,negative

you dont expect much from a prc picture and with rare exceptions mainly from edgar g ulmer and a few by joseph h lewis or lew landers thats exactly what you get not much this epic about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isnt much different the script by longtime prc hacks arthur st claire and sherman lowe is trite laughable full of unfunny wisecracks and plot holes the size of outer mongolia the direction by longtime prc no budget specialist al herman is semi comatose at best the performances though except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king arent really half bad veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up hes got great comic timing charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik despite his spanish accent and veteran bad guy george j lewis as renaldos arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch and she and renaldo have great chemistry together although like the rest of the cast she has none at all with king hb warner whose career stretched back to the silent era lends a shred of dignity to the low rent proceedings even though he blows his lines several times and prc being prc they werent cut out theres a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big budget silent movie with a similar arab theme although i have no idea which one it is and prc being prc no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous ive seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obviousa yank in libya isnt very good of course well ok it stinks but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor director albert brooks and super dave osborne but had never actually seen him in anything before it was worth watching this tenth rate prc extravaganza just to see him in action otherwise forget it,negative

it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this its truly one of the best acted most tightly structured films ive ever seen every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways relating to each of the three main characters differently the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go add to this that the slow burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything thats ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film it exposes the romance of movies such as titanic as the trite cliches they are if youre looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry this isnt it you have to commit yourself to this film you cant have a conversation while running in and out of the room this movie demands your attention treat it with the respect you deserve and youll get a lot out of it unless you think titanic is the greatest film ever,positive
the role of buddy ackerman is no stretch for kevin spacey hes played version of that character many times other better films this is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce the script leaves little time for plot or character development resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the good stuff the difference is that here the good stuff isnt people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain making it appropriate viewing for young adultsof course theres nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex and i guess theres nothing wrong with swimming with sharks if you want to watch people undergoing physical emotional and psychological torture but if youre looking for incisive satire interesting characters or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions you should probably look elsewhere,negative
one true thing rises above its potentially schlocky material to give us a view of a family of complex relationships and flawed real people it opens with rene zeleweger discussing her mothers death with the district attorney sparing us the cheap cinematic shots of a shocking illness and death from there it proceeds into a look at a family system in which everyone plays by a set of unexamined rules and uses the mothers cancer to show what happens when all the rules change william hurt as the self important father and meryl streep as the suzy homemaker mother are both superb nuanced and not what they appear to be zeleweger is seething angry and surprised with herself tom everett scott doesnt have much to do but he does it wellthe story is predictable and takes at least one badly soppy turn it neednt have taken but the performances and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed make it worthwhile,positive
probably grossly underrated by all who never experienced the hell of living under communist regime although it seems hard to believe all of it happened actually the reality was even worse than the movie it resembles orwellian fiction only this is no fiction john hurt is excellent as always yes the screenplay is not full of action but life is not either plot is breathtaking yes people were shot yes thousands of them their crime was that they wanted to leave communist paradise without government authorization at times the movie drives tears in your eyes we need more movies like this to really appreciate what america provides for us excellent movie highly recommend god bless our country usa,positive

if you pack all the clichés about city firefighters into minutes you have ladder it has a story but is highly clouded by all the clichés it turns it into movie that with every event becomes so predictable its not worth watching there is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficialit looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious the parallel between jack morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the twin towers was all too obviousit doesnt compare to movies like backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel,negative

youd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer couldnt help but be gripping but then youd be wrongthere is no plot there is no character development there is no redeeming visual beautythis movie is a waste of time the exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque the class relationships are glossed over and employer is a silly caricatureponderous silences and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning,negative
i dislike this movie a lot if youve read the puzos books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one youre going to agree with mecompared with the corleones saga presented by puzos novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous the characters and the relationships among them are distorted the story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movieit is understandable that different times should be expected for the corleones saga in the s and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before but in the other hand i dont know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didnt fit why this it sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original films qualitieswhat will never be understandable is the fact that mario puzo coppola and al pacino joined together to make this a man who directed pieces like apocalypse now and godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies so does al pacino for being the actor he is but mario puzo shouldnt have written this how come he damaged all his previous work what a shame my friend the puzos novel the last don is a s story about the mob and it is great we can never tell the same about the plot for the godfather iii,negative

for my first taste of shakespeare on stage i cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play lets start off with the good bit shall we alan rickman is alright although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling the rest of the actors needed to pull it together romeo romeo whyfore art thou not dead yet romeo the actor while not only completely wooden and deadpan could not read his lines with any gusto at all he was completely out of focus had difficulty even looking juliet in the face and absolutely no grace with the lines that he was given whoever cast him deserves to be punished juliet is almost passable but she gives no depth to her characterand seems to be completely out of touch with the play mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines i was forced to endure this half baked production of romeo and juliet the acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting i have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them i only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero,negative
i had watched and recorded this a few years back on local tv and having been underwhelmed by it i subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by mgm as part of a midnite movie double feature dvd of curtis harrington shelley winters films for a very affordable price i couldnt resist giving it a second look this has since gone out of print actually i received the dvd a few months ago but only now with harringtons passing did i get to it thankfully this time around i was more receptive to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying whatever happened to baby jane imitations with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter henry farrellthe film offers a splendid evocation of s depression america with its child star craze and sensational murders exploited during the fake newsreel opening its stylishly made kudos to lucien ballards cinematography and the set design by eugene lourie and boasts an effective david raksin score shelley winters debbie reynolds and michael macliammoir deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the larger than life and vaguely sinister diction coach though he ultimately proves a mere red herring also featured are dennis weaver and agnes moorehead hers is only a cameo really as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radiomany seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing mae west imitation but i personally wasnt bothered by them the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot reynolds a musical star herself is ideally cast as the dancing school owner and despite their on set rivalry she and winters work well together the latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in whoever slew auntie roo the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected grand guignol type denouement apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism by producer martin ransohoff against harringtons wishes in order to get a pg rating,positive
we have reached the ceiling of implausibility with this movie basically dinosaurs come aboard this ship piloted by some weird old fart named neweyeswhich i needed after i watched this movie apparently neweyes hears the wishes of children everywhere and decides that he should grant the wish of children that dinosaurs be brought into modern times to be seen by everybody for shameless exploitation the dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smartertoo bad the screenwriters didnt have it by the way does it seem weird that out of all the wishes of the children in the world neweyes grants the wish of bringing dinosaurs to modern times why not grant the wishes of kids to stop famine disease war i mean come on doesnt neweyes have anything better to do with all this power he has finally when the dinosaurs get to modern times they start singing dancing and wrecking havocbasically the kind of thing you might see on a bad lsd trip i mean where else could you see a t rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of spider man they end up in the circus and neweyes brother screweyes makes the kids that have befriended the dinosaurs sign a blank contract why why would kids sign a blank contract screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take somebrain drain that he will let the children go the dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil screweyes limb from limb give in and agree to his terms what this is stupid they could have just menaced him made him drop the contract eaten it then walked off with the kids i think the filmmakers were trying to show that violence is bad which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs escape and a bunch of crows envelop screweyes and apparently completely eat him oh yeah thats not violent at all were back makes no sense its not fun its goofy its stupid poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever committed to film even for a kids film this is bad,negative
this show proved to be a waste of minutes of precious dvr hard drive space i didnt expect much and i actually received less not only do i expect this show to be canceled by the second episode i cannot believe that geico will ever attempt to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again i would have preferred spending a night checking my daughters hair for head lice than watching this piece of refuse i wonder what abc passed on to make this show fit into the fall schedual perhaps a hospital crime mocumentary reality show featuring the aflac duck in the event that i failed to express my opinion about this show let me be clear and say that it is not too good,negative
not much to say other than it is simply a masterpiece this film contains a myriad of messages that all should take to heart especially women do not squelch your mans dreams honor them thats why you loved him in the first place those who plan for death will live in the grave those who carpe diem will awaken those who live in fear even our lord spoke of this when he chastised the the one who buried his talent in fear that he might make a mistake and displease the master take a risk get out of the boat and you will walk on water life is a journey that does not end in the grave but in our minds and souls,positive
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because unlike thoroughbred jockeys men of normal height and weight can be drivers yes the home in indiana is a better movie but its also a very different movie april love is light and easy to watch a feel good movie disappointing though that pat boones religious moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl quite a change from todays standard fare home in indiana with walter brennan filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment,positive
yeah its a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but its actually pretty good and i consider myself a manly man you gotta love judy davis no matter what shes in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performancethe scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an go see it,positive
life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for but to be effective they must also be entertaining unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round the first such work to become really widely known was probably george orwells first published in and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a filmwatch or read it and then when you are feeling a little depressed by mans inhumanity to man reach for cinderella this is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing and as with the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments to exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a dvd or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption there are many worse films appearing as dvds these days and frankly i do not care much what happens either wayso far the best of the films of this genre has probably been the handmaidens tale but i would very happily swap them all for a well made film of jack londons towering novel the iron heel ambitious as this would be it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it imdb only lists a b w silent version made in russia in,negative
words fail me whenever i want to describe my feelings about this movie and the sequels does it have flaws sure it does starting with the subspecies themselveswhich were not executed well enough for a special effectso why do i glorify these movies for the herd of movie mass consumers out therewho care more about quantity than qualityabout cheap fun more than about depth crap like blade it doesnt even deserve a capital letterunderworlddracula dracula and so on are good movies to munch popcorn to and drink a couple of cokes what makes subspecies a superior effort for anyone claiming to be a vampire fanaticon the other handis obvious the vampire himself is romanianthe story is set in transylvania the scenes filmed on location are more than convincingand the atmosphere is not based on any action packed chases or expensive orchestral musicradu himself is the source of the atmosphere this is what a vampire should look like and this is how he should behave add a breathtakingly gloomy castle with dark passageways situated in romaniainclude some typical vampiric elements such as the movement of the shadows on the walls when the vampires take to flight and you have a work of art in shortif like meyou re fascinated with vampires and feel that their appearance as well as the setting should be sinister and darktheres no better place to look in than in a subspecies movie or in vampire journalsthe brilliant spin off of the former,positive
i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all but just barely its sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd exposing people who may not be too familiar with lh to their worst stuff rather than their classic comediesonce again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy whos invented an invisible ray hes in love with the bosses daughter who hates him and prefers some slick guy its incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what lh needed in their filmswithout their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy insurance on stanotherwise this script is just a mess forget this and see if you can find a copy of a chump at oxford or bohemian girl or sons of the desert instead,negative
this cheap grainy filmed italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the italian countryside who head up to the house to stay and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that housei wasnt impressed by this it wasnt really that scary mostly just the way a cheap italian film should be a girl her two cousins and one cousins girlfriend head to this huge house for some reason i couldnt figure out why and are staying there cleaning up and checking out the place characters come in and out of the film and its quite boring at points and the majority of deaths are quite rushed the girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death and the scene is quite good but then things get slow again until a confusing end when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way and this weirdo guy i couldnt figure out who he was during the movie or maybe i just dont remember goes after this one girl attacking her until finally this other girl kills him off hate to give away the ending but oh well the female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it and they show scenes of her living there years later the end you really arent missing anything and anyway you probably wont find this anywhere so lucky you,negative

small spoilers alert good movievery good movie and im surprised to say that myself because im not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the directors name deran serafian usually means bad news most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action this movie really fascinated me good accomplishment seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved it really is the story that keeps you focused especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle of course thats where the reality and the based on a true story stops the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stokerin this movie the count vlad teppish emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman and theyre all pretty girls ill give him that overall good acting by unknown faces enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr heck its a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title these two films have nothing else in common but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture check it outmy humble opinion on to die for,positive
cliché ridden story of an impending divorce or is it through the eyes of a year old child corny dialogue cardboard characters stock situations a red herring zombie sub plot and worst of all absolutely no payoff either emotionally or dramaticallydoes no one teach creative writing any more the true sign of a weak storyteller when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement just end the story im compelled to ask what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place good but wasted debut by child actor anthony de marco the rest of the cast was at best forgettable and they wonder why no one watches indie films this is ninety minutes of my life i will never get back,negative
dorothy provine does the opposite here she keeps growing and growing i didnt detect any subtext though the incredible shrinking man and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation nuclear war and other horrors provines growth is the result of an inept computer robotand who operates this computer but lou costello i like some of his movies with bud abbott but though this is a pretty bad movie he does fine without him and gale green is an excellent foilgreen plays the pompous town big shot he is provines father he is intent on being elected mayor so when his beloved daughter starts having issues he dumps her he doesnt exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer costellothis is pretty implausible costello is the local garbage collectorthe special effects are minimal and the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme,negative
this one is bad a really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing out of the ordinary in it a series of crimes the killer that you do not see throughout the whole movie the classic investigations and also the classic tale about a cop who figures out whats going on and isnt believed by anyone so he has to fight by himself to reveal the truth not too much in this one vote out of,negative

this film was such a mess i actually reimbursed my friends who i dragged to see it the only reason i went to see it was that my friend was an apprentice editor on the shootim sure that this film was meant to be campy but the approach was so heavy handed and self reflexive it turned out really flat judd nelson stars as an obsequious garbage man who is a hack comedian on the side his life is hell and made worse by his obnoxious and overbearing companion bill paxton who i feel embarrassed for this was a really tasteless role for a talented actor a freak accident alters nelsons career course and mayhem ensuesthe attempts at humor were corny predictable and often base and tasteless wayne newton in the cast as a talent agent is a novelty but he adds nothing comedically or otherwiseoverall its a very weak and uncreative attempt at camp humor that goes over like a lead balloon at least you could laugh at plan from outer space this one just makes you wonder who thought this was a good enough idea to finance and film one of the all time worst bombs youll ever witness,negative
i happened on shower in the foreign film section of my local video store and passed it over several times since from its cover it looked like a farce or comedy i then lucked into a copy to purchase at economical price and am happy for my luck shower is the story of three men a father and two adult sons each coming to terms with life changes as the world around them also continues to change in modern china as with many foreign films the chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting facets of this moviebeyond the fascinating characteristics of the local chinese color giving the setting to this story is the difficult yet touching relationships between the men and a sole woman involved in the story all set against the backdrop of a village bathhousethe familys story moves from estrangement to understanding and made me glad i came to know these people added to the main story are the numerous small characters bathhouse customers and their individual conflicts and friendships shower is a film one walks away from smiling and touched by its warmth and humanity,positive
thunderball and never are two of the biggest box office misses and never is a surprise farce from empire strikes back hero irvin kershner klaus maria brandauer seems to steal the show when in the midst of the unfolding plot bonds mission turns more to hollywood romp sometime around when basinger comes in how about klaus kinski i still think that the casting of largo makes or as is evident in both films breaks the story worst of all is the attempt to pass off the aging and very hairy connery off as the sex symbol he indeed was in the s the s was a barren time for bond flicks mostly though for your eyes only is a great title at times when i happen to need to waste some time over the holidays by watching this film in the often string of bond re run festivals i think the best attribute of the film is its score and im not into soft s jazz,negative

an independent feature can now be seen as both a work of film art and a video resume enter broken and aggressively promoted twenty minute short with style and enthusiams to spare but is it any good as a film or does it only work as a demo piece ah there in lies the rubbroken is the story of bonnie clayton who is abducted after awakening from a reoccurring nightmare one night by a sadistic stranger and his colorful entourage quote from the video box as shes held captive it becomes obvious that her abductors know things about her that even she didnt know about herself while they question her a black clad soldier guns his way into their hideout in an attempt to rescue her mayhem ensuesfortunately for us director alex ferrari seems to know what hes doing or at least hes very good at faking it broken does not suffer from any lack of visual flair which is especially commendable considering its budget and the inexperience of all involved what it does suffer from is weak and kind of derivative writing think long kiss goodnight meets the matrix written ten minutes after reading fight club the good news for ferrari and producer writer jorge rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display does the plot really matter that much in a twenty minute short meant to show off the technical skills of its creators no not reallythough it would be unfair of me to overlook any negative aspects in light of the films budget and length broken is no genre classic the biggest problem was that it actually would have worked better as a full length feature the final twist doesnt get enough build up time to be shocking if ferrari were allowed the time to slow burn the feature as needed plot elements would seem less random and the film more complete heres to knowing hes getting the chanceaudio brokens dolby digital presentation is second to none in the indie world ive never heard such aggressive surround from such a small feature the matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep gunshots have punch and even the dialogue gets in on the surround effects of everything presented on this disc it is the audio that speaks the praise for modern independent dvd production also included is an equally impressive dolby surround track which is the menu defaultextras there are literally hours of making of features to be found on this disc there are so many extras in fact that i find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them here while still expecting my readers to continue reading whatever shortcomings the actual short may have the dvd is unprecedented in its informational resources people who enjoyed the film can learn all there is to know about its production including everything from the conceptual art to the promotional campaign those with plans to make an indie film of their own can learn just about everything they need to know from these featuresthe extras are broken down into categorical menus these include pre production production post production after the short and cast and crew bios from a critical standpoint i found that some of the sections were quite short had they been edited into one featurette per menu option they wouldve been less frustrating to navigate as the curser defaults to the top selection with every return to the main section menu this is of course just nitpicking but perhaps for future dvd releases the filmmakers will take my advice to heartit has six audio commentaries and hours of interview footage and talented people and despite the consonant salesmanship their true colours do shine throughthe willingness to share their film making secrets with anyone who picks up this dvd is quite generous from the extras i learned what editing and effects software is most reliable and effective what brand of camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price even where to get cheap air soft weaponry on top of this i was given several alternate options in case i found myself unable to locate any products used on this particular production wannabe filmmakers unwilling to read a book on the subject would do well to watch this dvdoverall ive scored the actual short as a out of but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because id have scored it an or in these fields i recommend the dvd for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with a mere eight thousand american dollars those who purchase the dvd can think of themselves as ghost producers for a larger project as the more attention these guys get the more funding the feature length version will get,positive

im from phoenix city and the first time i saw this movie and read the book it only confirmed the stories i had heard all of my life i asked my grandfather about the mob and he told me that when he got back from fighting in the pacific theatre he started up a cpa firm that is know the largest in the columbus area when he was just starting out he was asked by the mob to do financial work for them but he said that he gently declined even when the fbi and army came through phoenix city and cleaned it up my grandfather wouldnt take it lightly when my mom aunt or uncle went across the river but i assure you all of that is over now the downtown area of phoenix city is in need of restoration and it has slums by the courthouse where all of the shooting still occasionally takes place over angry uneducated low socio economic people and the th street phoenix eagle bridge has been shut down for a solid years and replaced by a newer th street bridge but on the more fair side of phoenix city on summerville rd it is very quaint and the scenery depressinganother incident was told to me by my best friends family from high school that lives in a nothing spot on hwy called holy trinity alabama which is about minutes outside of columbus ga my best friend in high schools uncle was a man that went by the name of old man davis regardless of how the movie goes that fact is that there were bosses and old man davis was one of themyou can even read about him in the original book legend has it that he was so cold blooded that he went to downtown phoenix city to make a deal with a man but apparently the man backed out on the deal right in front of old man davis so the old man davis proceeded to take a sawed off shotgun out of his coat and shoot the man in the chest in the middle of town by the courthouse they say he even walked off nonchalantly because the mob had paid off every law enforcement official in town so he had nothing to worry aboutanother incident is about a bridge that another one of my friends owns a rental house next to in downtown phoenix city it is the same bridge that the mob killed and threw a black man off of and you can even read that part in the book i also would like to as that in many columbus and phoenix city civilians were asked to be extras in the movie when the pattersons friend is murdered and brought to trial and proved guilty in front of the judge but still set free well the judge is my fathers partner in his law firm in columbus who unfortunatlly is deceased,positive
lindsay anderson was very much a european film maker whereas the likes of david lean ridley scott and alan parker make spectacular movies involving visuel scope andersons movie are more about social commentary and subtext so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience what you think of if comes down to what you think of british film makers im very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium the best brit movie makes are those who try to emulate hollywood in my opinion if you want to send a message try pony express and i find the movie dated pretentious and too set in the s was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in france you can just imagine every single french leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax french new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it and many will dislike it intensely,negative

why did they have to make such a dreadful adaptation the whole complete jane austin series as a part of masterpiece classics looks like a huge disappointment characters are totally miscast and theres no chemistry on the screen the whole thing feels rather rushed the movie release based on the same novel seems like a masterpiece compared to this i really want to forget it im really happy though that pride and prejudice wont be re made as part of this project and we will see the iconic and magnificent colin firth and jennifer elle as protagonists if you skipped this mansfield park production consider yourself lucky,negative
rebecca de mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts shes given to playif you cannot say something nicede mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that shes a grown up and has become a of course brilliant shrinkshe has an affair with banderas whom we suspect of being ouchhow original a serial killersometimes she recalls banderass mother in law tippi hedrens character in marnie but i wouldnt count on ithitchcock died twenty four years ago and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected endbut that ending is so far fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy itthe movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the lamb traditionmurders human beings and catssplit personalityand open ending in case the crowds should call for moreapparently they did notand they were right,negative
ulysses as a film should in no way be compared with the novel for they are two entirely different entities however that being said the film still manages to maintain many of the elements that made the book work but since it is a visual medium it is more difficult to pull of stream of consciousness i think this is the best film they could have made with the material and this is from someone that routinely rants about films not being like their literary counterparts i recommend the book but the movie is still entertaining,positive
because some people like me like to know everything about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending anyway heres the ending as i remember it because i couldnt have been more than yrs old when i saw it for the first and only time on tv but ill tell ya it sure scared the little kid that i was and i thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague abe vigoda was in this movie i dont remember that i didnt even remember that ol barnabus was in this movie and i loved dark shadows so at the end the lead character belinda montgomery is lured by the judge joseph cotton im guessing even though i remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as i remember it is in a cavern of some kind maybe ive got that wrong and shelley winters is there laughing and the judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces hes actually her father the devil and shes played right into their the satanic cults hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with i guess thats robert foxworth turns out also to be the guy satan wants to marry her off to the demon with yellow eyes and yep sure enough they show robert foxworth and his eyes glow yellow there are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for belinda montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and thats the end the bad guys win,negative
this film released in has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the s the cavalry needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to merge together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a fort located close to the indian village until reinforcements arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is undermanned and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the valiant is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they dont accept that chargegregory peck embodies the tight lipped captain of the troop that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small outpost are the dregs of the troop at the fort they in turn have gripes or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasnt taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the hostiles and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western stalwarts such as ward bond gig young neville brand lon chaney jr and warner anderson a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre,positive
without doubt the best of the novels of john le carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film performances by peter egan magnus pym the perfect spy rudiger weigang axel real name alexander hampel magnus czech intelligence controller ray mcanally magnus con man father and alan howard jack brotherhood magnus mentor believer and british controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major membury are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of magnus one cannot help but feel closer to magnus and axel than to jack brotherhood and the slimy grant lederer of us intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others,positive
boy this movie had me fooled i honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever boy i got the cold shoulder that time this movie was and im truthful pretty damn good it was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch i almost laughed at how bad it was but to some extent i enjoyed it the killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and christmas which made things more intriguing the pov camera angles were awesomethe movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison he is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture these were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman he than takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who convicted himthis movie had such bad acting with the exception of christopher allport that is was funny i will say that i am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror but in fact a dark sitcom they had a great story with a good plot but it wasnt executed right all in all i like the movie at first but now it is really annoying but this movie is way better and darker than the sequel,negative
i rented this film because i enjoy watching things with lauren graham in them well she was the highlight everyone else seemed complete separated from the picture you kept looking around you at those watching the film with you going what however she provided some clarity as she was the only normal character in the picture which actually isnt saying much for the film personally it was too far fetched for me however i am glad i rented despite the fact i would never want to own it i still feel that lauren graham proved to be a strong actress and even thought she was not the main character she seemed to steal the movie my husband and i were happier and cared more about her character ending up with joshs character than we were about the two main characters,negative
as i recall my family made a point to stay home on the night nichols was on mondays tuesdays nbc it was a superb vehicle for james garner very well written great ensemble cast his character very much like the support your local films retired gambler with mysterious past settles into town and has adventures every week in fact it seemed fairly obvious that it was the same character it was just a charmer of a tv show a sleeper like my world and welcome to it which may have been its contemporary i forget i dearly wish these shows would be made available on dvd it was just good tv perhaps briscoe county jr come close but only by a mile,positive
ive watched hundreds of kung fu movies and ive heard some good thing about this movie so i decided to give it a try what i saw was one of the worst displays of movie making ive ever seeni cant help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in hong kong in this movie everyone overacts to the point of stupidity even conan the barbarian had some civility this movie just has half evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self respect the narrators character shouldve be killed for sucking so muchshe really didnt deserve to live til the end the entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action they shouldve just rename this movie to the stupid one armed caveman with a blade heres a questionwhy do some director use quick cuts for some action movies answer to can hide the deficiencies of the actors nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow the movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung fu moviesor any taste in movies,negative
this film fails on every count for a start it is pretentious striving to be significant and failing miserably the script was banal in the extreme nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting it was impossible to care about any of the characters knightly was a self regarding waste of time whilst sienna miller was just a waste of time the bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film atonement used it the use of the second world war as a backdrop was in itself a clichéthe bombs the sheltering in tube stations etcemployed to import a bit of much needed drama why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension it was yet another case of lets get the costumes looking authentic never mind about the story the script or the acting,negative
reign over me adam sandler don cheadle jada pinkett smith liv tyler saffron burrows donald sutherland robert klein melinda dillon mike binder jonathan banks rae allen paula newsome at times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on sandler in his best role since punch drunk love who winds up re united with his old college roommate and friend cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date a well to do dentist who seems to have it all family wealth happiness but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friends own personal life offerings written and directed by binder who co stars as sandlers former best friend and acting accountant with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie of the week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand,positive
the saddest thing about this film is that only people cared to leave a review of it and no one felt it worthwhile leaving a comment on the message boardsmade the same year as philadelphiathe tom hanks oscar winner this is the film that people really should have seen and given awards to there is more humanity life love tenderness and beauty in these two people than in just about any other gay film i have seen and it is all truein order for this to be printed i need to leave a few more lines of text suffice it to say that anyone who really wants to know what it was like to be gay in the s and s and to understand just what aids was like before the modern drug cocktails allowed people to breathe a little easier this is the film to see oh and i will add a personal comment about aids despite everything there actually has been a silver lining to all the horror when aids first arrived it was called the gay cancer and governments preferred to let them die rather than spend a red cent on research to help save a bunch of fags then it became clear that aids would also be a heterosexual disease but the government wasnt ready for that so when straight people began getting ill too the only organizations and associations that were available to them were those which had been set up by gays themselves examples the names project the quilt memorializing all those who died of aids act up etc the result is that people who probably would never have come in contact with gays in their ordinary lives suddenly found themselves counting on them and needing them because no other organizations existed this close contact in my estimation is what finally broke down the barriers of prejudice and allowed the straight world to finally accept gays as equals when aids first came on the scene many of us thought that the straight world would use it as a way to come down even harder on us and that probably would have been true if straights didnt suddenly become ill too nevertheless the strides that have been made in gay liberation to the point that as i write this there are at least countries in the world that accept gay marriage these gains would probably have taken a lot longer without aids to bring us together it is sad to think that all those people both straight and gay had to die before our common humanity became more obvious but if what i am writing here is true and i think it is then there is a bit of comfort to be taken in realizing that all those people did not die in vain,positive
well i saw this movie during the last san sebastian film festival the reaction to it waslets say as funny as the movie unintetionally is it happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles they seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish it was all confusing the genders were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and i remember great lines but because they were so absurd all in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead visible secret is your film,negative
its a studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become hollywoods next great movie star and hes the director thats going to make it happen after inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops his dream comes true being completely absorbed in his film making however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man several over budget flops later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down rin tin tin fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego hell be okay as long as he still has his friendsthis movie starts out as a mad cap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them it has a playful lack of self consciousness which is sorely missing in most of todays comedies shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film these are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn its well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to beby the end of the film it has transformed once again this time into a paean to the glitter of hollywood the small town of los angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole worldin spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for,positive
arthur hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man probably the ozarks who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog however the dog appears to be drowning when hunnicutt jumps in after him it becomes obvious pretty soon that despite hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dogs death yet oddly hunnicutt is really slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him i think this was actually done as padding as there really wasnt enough material to fill the half hour time slotlater in the surprise twist he comes upon heaven or at least his concept of the place hes invited in but since they wont allow dogs he has other ideas overall reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value with no twists or irony this episode is a bit dull not twilight zone y enough for my tastes,negative
it occurred to me while the final scene of the movie froze to reveal the scant detail of buddy hollys death that there are still people alive today who were at that venue in clearlake iowa who remember it vividly that has to be a haunting memory lent even more poignancy by the lyrics of american pie as it pays tribute to the day the music died the world lost some tremendous talent that day lives cut short way before their prime and one can only wonder what might have been if the trio of musicians who perished that day had survived to create an even greater musical legacyi watched the film today some thirty years after its original theatrical release thirty years i have some trouble wrapping my mind around that i had forgotten a lot of it while remembering some of the little things like the cricket in the wall who became immortalized with the bands name but most of all i remember the music its hard just to sit there and not begin tapping to the beat of oh boy or thatll be the day and one has to wonder just where the threat to our morals might have actually come from with those tunes im with buddy on that score at least how could they be jungle rhythms if he came up with them funny how each successive decade brought its own threat to the fabric of society the beatles motown disco and a whole host of other musical forms were still listening and dancing to the beat so i guess they couldnt have been all that badthere was another takeaway from the film i had forgotten about this is where i learned to bang a phone on the table when the person on the other end wasnt seeing things my way ive done that a number of times over the years but by now had forgotten the source well i should be good for another thirty years or so nowyou certainly have to give gary busey credit for his portrayal of buddy holly seeing him today one could never imagine him as the slimmed down rocker with the horn rimmed glasses but it was a tour de force characterization and performance that earned busey an oscar nod don stroud and charles martin smith are competent as buddys band members though their characters take a back seat to much of the story i enjoyed the subtle ways that other musical legends were segued into the picture names like sam cooke and king curtis without ever dwelling on their presence ill always be a fan and follower of music from the fifties and sixties oldies they call them now i guess that makes me a bit of an oldie too but you cant replace the experience of growing up with the music history that now makes it to the big screen which only goes to reinforce the idea that ill keep on enjoying the music until well the day i die,positive
i am terribly sorry i know that fabinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post war germany and that most of his films are considered master pieces but when i see lili marleen today in i wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie the acting is simply terrible hanna schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot the changings between nazi glamour and battlefields are ridiculous the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for real art but for me this movie is simply bad cheap compare this to viscontis la caduta degli dei and tell me again that lili marleen is a good movie,negative
the western can be divided into many sub genres one of the broadest divisions is that between town westerns and plains westerns most westerns are a mix of both but at one end of the spectrum you have pictures like high noon and rio bravo that take place almost entirely in a settlement seldom venturing out into the real outdoors at the other end you have ones like wagon master where there is barely a homestead on view amid the wildernessdirector john ford normally thrived on the bit of both westerns shooting the interiors with an emphasis on their being small and confined and then contrasting this with the wide open exteriors which appeared both exciting and dangerous wagon master has a typical frank nugent script with some interplay between seasoned oldsters and green youngsters but still it presents ford with some fresh challenges in this picture the dangers do not come from the harshness of the landscape they come from within the group in the form of the cleggses whats more the absence of real interior scenes means the outdoors could lose its impact over timehowever ford was a real maestro when it came to manipulating space he shoots scenes of the camp or the wagons so the frame is surrounded and we get that same sense of enclosure as we would in a genuine interior also compared to his other westerns he does not in fact open out the space too much having the wagon trail wend its way through canyons and passes rather than cross the stark and empty plains one of the few moments where he does throw the landscape wide open is when the indians are spotted and there is the possibility of a threat from outsidewagon master features some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief and some great contributions from the quirky cast harry carey jr was shaping up into a fine actor like his pa and this is one of his better early roles joanne dru was disappointing in she wore a yellow ribbon but she appears more at ease as a character with a bit of sass and is actually fairly good here jane darwell who won an oscar in the john ford directed grapes of wrath a decade earlier appears here with sole function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a feeble old horn still with her great timing and movement she makes the piece work francis ford in one of the many mute drunkard roles he played in his little brothers pictures is at his cheeky bestand now we come to lead man ben johnson although he was by no means a bad actor he was never going to become a big star like john wayne and yet with his effortless horsemanship and easygoing drawl he was one of the most authentically west players around and this brings me onto my final point this was apparently one of fords personal favourites despite it seeming fairly unassuming wagon master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity it is simply the genre playing itself out i think this is what ford loved about it its a picture for the ben johnsons and the harry carey jrs not the john waynes or the henry fondas small in scope but worthy in its class,positive
i have been watching horror movies since i was years old beginning with childs playsince then i have seen good horror movies and bad but this is without question the dumbest movie i have ever seen the actors did all they could with the material the plot was just idiotic plus it was just all gore i can stomach a lot of blood but that was just ridiculous in one of the scenes a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines plain stupid another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made the end of it is just dumb but then again it goes with the rest of it at the end when the girl gets away from the cannibal ancestor she receives help from a old lady the old lady is making tea but when she turns around to talk to the girl the girl attacks her she turned into a cannibal retarded movie,negative

this was the very first movie i ever saw in my life back in or i was years old at the time and saw it at a drive in theatre i did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time i went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie after seeing it on the television along with two of my other favourite movies car wash my favourite movie and the wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all together about times i knew that here was a movie that i would have as one of my favourites those three movies were the only live action shows that i could watch as a child i would not consider this to be a blaxploitation movie but rather an urban interest moviecochise and preach reminded me of some of my uncles especially the wild irish rose that they drank my mother also told me about some of the quarter parties that she attended and that some of the things that occurred in the movie were similar in nature to what occurred in real life if you are one of the two or three black people over thirty who hasnt seen this movie yet then i recommend that you buy the dvd right now im glad that i was around to witness some of the goings on of the era,positive
although this film is set amongst the sophisticated english upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder it has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of a way through the wood a novel by nigel balchin once hugely popular and now forgotten julian fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of gosford park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed the latter for the first time with the dvd version i saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by julian his primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded in this he was helped by two outstanding performances from tom wilkinson as james the stitched up city lawyer and emily watson as his attractive wife anne he also kept it short the running time is only minutesjames and anne have a town house in chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in buckinghamshire anne is some years younger but they are childless outwardly they seem happy but james one of natures moralists unusual for a city lawyer is a control freak just down the road is the aristocratic the hon william buel who is not one for middle class morality and he is more than happy to take advantage but theres a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven range rover just like the hon bills soon james anne bill and the victims widow who happens to be james and annes cleaner are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened the primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on james and annes relationshipthe third person in this ménage a trios bill is played by rupert everett from the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesnt quite get there partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and vice versa the part seems underdeveloped it is interesting that john neville as bills father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he hasthe world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked as julian fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the edwardian age still exists at bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart nigel balchin was going through a marriage break up when he wrote the book and fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere as he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same,positive
its two years after the iranian embassy siege which involved the dramatic sas rescue from the balconys and with a war with argentina over the falkland islands currently taking place what better film to make than a gung ho sas film that re creates the iranian hostage siege whilst using britains number one action hero of the day lewis collins throw in edward woodward and a few other well known actors and youve got a winner on your handswell maybe not the film itself doesnt make the situation serious enough whilst the acting is quite second rate its like a movie long episode of the professionals but without the formula this film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable maybe cubby brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch lewis collins as a touted james bond replacement for roger moore watch it if your a fan of lewis collins or sas stuff in general if not save your time,negative
there was nothing else on tv yesterday afternoon so i thought okay lets watch this i didnt know the plot and i had no expectation whatsoever i was thinking in a few minutes or so i will channel surf again but then story started to unfold and the characters played beautifully by the two boys the story did have unrealistic parts and scenes but overall it was a real good movie very well worth watching,positive
based on an actual mining disaster this early german talkie with english subtitles still remains one of the most effective docu dramas ever filmed featuring many non professional actors kameradschaft gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers regardless of which side of the french german border they may be from a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone nullifying any superiors orders a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades even at threat of great loss including lifethis film reminds of the self sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the attacks putting aside any formal rules and regulations these men and women in uniform knew only one cause to save lives and to find their fellow fire fighters more than years later kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message a friend in need is a friend in deed,positive
i have barely managed to view the entire film only after about min out of the movies min did the journey to mars begin and then there were min left for the closure these long minutes were very boring and didnt contribute anything to the film when finally reaching mars it wasnt much better plot wise it all could have been fitted into much shorter running time and nothing would have been missedwhat i cannot understand is the piece of trivia saying the because of the film new born babies were named aelita why would someone want to name his her baby after a villain who despite having only one eyebrow apparently has breaststhe only interesting thing here is the sets and costumes for the mars scenes they are an interesting experiment in constructivism just as the cabinet of dr caligari was for expressionism five years earlieri give it for the great looking design,negative
quite good dont expect anything high culturethe acting is bad the storyline fails but it is still a fairly nice movie to watch why because its dark a little bit stupid like unpredictable and just entertaining and fun to watch do not expect anything like i said just see it for yourself and you know what i meanit is a movie without a plot or memorable acting but there are enough scenes that will make you laugh cry or at least make you feel compelled to watch it to the endthis is all i wanted to say,positive
i loved this flick when it came out in the s and still do i still quote classic lines like say it again and you said youd rip my balls off sir ron leibman was hot and very funny although it was underrated and disowned by mad i have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that i would take with me if sent to a deserted island i only wish that someone would release the dvd because my vhs tape is about worn out if you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic it is military humor at its best and worse rent it if you cant own it,positive
tourist trap is among my favorite late s early s horror flicks a group of young people are heading somewhere one pair in the car ahead that car has a flat and our film opens with the young man woody pushing the tire along looking for a service station he finds a seemingly abandoned place and yet hears voices and investigates and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts along comes the rest of the young folks in a vw thing and they pick up woodys girlfriend and find this very same place slausens oasis or some such thingand then mr slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream of course the vw thing has mysteriously died at that point so odd mr slausen chuck connors offers his help mr slausen has a museum with lots of wax figures and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house where he says davey lives and who is davey why davey crockett he saysbut if it were davey crockett theyd all probably be safer the girls are left alone while slausen goes to help with fixing the car but of course curiosity gets the better of one she goes to investigate and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one nameddavey what follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one theyre taken prisoner by davey who says hes slausens brother one girl kidnapped earlier is treated to a plaster facial which results in her death when it covers up her air supply at any rate theres somewhat of a twist to this and kind but weird mr slausen is not exactly what he appears to be a good creepy late s horror flick and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere out of,positive
there comes a time in every big name actors career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldnt have touched with a ft pole in their golden days remember taxi driver that was a fine film i can hardly believe that the de niro of showtime is the same actori would rather watch time chasers twice than see this film again if anyone offers to take you to see showtime or gives you free passes or whatever run away as fast and far as you can,negative
the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local ktla tv ch during every christmas season during the mid to late s mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the peruvian jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a rankin bass production,positive
it stars war correspondent william holden separated who falls in love with a stunning eurasian doctor jessica jones set against the stunning backdrop of hong kong the cinematography is magnificent as they rendezvous on a hill overlooking hong kong the story deals with racial tensions society frowning on mixed relations and extra marital affairs but what i love about it is the strong character of the heroine portrayed by jessica jones who is a eurasian doctor who stays humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and stays loyal to her love despite that she gets sacked at her hospital for cavorting with a married man by gossipping high rankers one day william holden is called to the korean war which he covers and then that ill fated day she gets the news of his demise the end of course is tragic i cried when she went to their hill it was a very sweet ill fated love affair it defeats all the odds the fact that she got fired from her job how his wife would not grant him a divorce yet their great love persevered they experienced a great love despite it all i personally do not believe in extramarital affairs and think he should have not started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed herself to let it happen but despite that a truly magnificent movie i think the heroine overshadowed the hero jessica jones is sultry and gave a magnificent performance although i thought it strange they didnt not hire a real asian actress or someone with asian blood i agree with one review jessica jones oozes sexuality when she lays on the ground and looks up at william holden speaking calmly but her eyes say come take me nowi find it a pity most great films were made before i was born it seems many hollywood movies are lacking in depth great acting and depend entirely on stunts and heavy sex scenes this is truly one of the greatest ill fated love stories in movies,positive
im so glad i only got this movie for anime is expensive no doubt about that ive had my eye on this one for awhile and finally i saw it on sale i grabbed it immediately and took it home only to hang my head in disappointment this movie sucked ive heard people talk about how gory and violent this movie is its really not that gory or violent ive watched it three times and i think ive wasted enough of my life on this the demons get a point for being unique and kinda cool at times the sex gets a point since its almost non stop the horny old man gets half a point for being horny and still having the sex drive and the main character whos name ive erased from my mind gets half a point for the cool design of his gun i saw major connections between this movie and demon city shinjuku both have same style animation thats obvious because of the director both have lame soundtracks which suck like the antichrist and both have terrible endings avoid this movie unless youre into anime sex,negative
this has got to be the funniest movie i have seen in forever chritopher guest is truly talented he has a gift for humor i almost died laughing actually when i saw this in theaters i considered walking out because the movie was so dumb but it is dumb in a good way it is funny dumb and this is a really good combination you will be laughing from start to endthis mockumentary style film follows an array of characters all competing at the kennel club dog show the cast includes parker posey fred willard eugene levy catherine ohara john michael higgens michael mckean larry miller bob balaban jennifer coolidge and tons more this is a truly funny movie that will have everyone laughing someone born without a personality would laugh at this film it is presented in widescreen to give the image that you are viewing an actual documentary and that is probably what adds to the hilarity best in show,positive
this show seemed to be kinda good kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong first of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it every time that makes it boring the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way i know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief the crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way as stated above i hate it all in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed,negative
i couldnt believe the eye candy from start to finish being a fan of movies directed by music video masterminds i am happy to report that the photography in this motion picture is a splendor for the eye to behold there are so many rich full images that are put before me that each and every time that i see this movie i find something new that i had not seen before as with previous movies that i have seen such as blade and mystery men also by former music video directors the use of color to capture ones attention is utilized extremely well though the characters could have been developed better the action and costuming was well worth the price of admission i recommend you buy this one for your dvd collection even if you havent seen this on the big screen you wont be disappointed i know i wasnt,positive
before there was crash there was this interesting film called grand canyon released about years sooner than the former film grand canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime to me crash was still a slightly better film but grand canyon was no slouch eithertaking place in los angeles an upper class lawyer named mack kevin kline takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time he calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps simon danny glover to take the truck away both men are threatened but simon manages to get himself mack and the car out of dire straits it is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with mack helping out simon just as simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier you see simons sister deborah tina lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking simon up with his secretarys friend jane alfre woodardthis is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above mary louise parker as well as macks wife mary mcdonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son roberto jeremy sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon the details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes this simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the storythe director lawrence kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was the big chill has created a splendid movie here the cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that wouldve made the film even stronger are glossed over the story involving the secretary is one and the second involving simons nephew is the other these scenes shouldve been more apart of the entire story and then maybe lawrence kasdans views of life between the upper and lower classes wouldve been more on a superior level instead of just very good still grand canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after there is also a small role for steve martin as davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movies ideas,positive
yes thats true that movie is a horrible piece of you know what almost all fans of sapkowskis books in poland think the same the truth is that polish cinematography can not afford producing fantasy films its a shame when you compare wiedzmin and conan the barbarian for example i hope no one outside poland will ever see this nightmare,negative
the guy who wrote directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change yes rob stefaniuk i mean you seriously who funded this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on i think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful the jokes are so not funny i understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey but do it with style this movie is screaming saturday night live skits why i say again why do studios give money to hacks like rob stefaniuk never give a comedian the opportunity to write direct and star in his own movie duh,negative
what exactly was going on during world war in new zealand when american forces were therethis awful story of sisters was really pathetic to view can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee fontaine looked more like her mother even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the filmpiper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry years later in the hustler have no scenes together in this film laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there despite the fact that she is married woe to her when her husband comes back from the warjean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman there is even romance for the young miss dee herethe picture has little to no meaning are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war if they are they did a poor job in selling thisthe conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of,negative
sorry for any spoilers that this contains but if you want to read on anyway i really wonder why so many people are so high on kevin williamson lets just take a quick look at his work as a screenwriter shall we theres scream and plus the story for the next one which i think are pretty funny but very overrated besides by making scream into a franchise it ceased to become a parody of horror movies and simply became another one then theres i know what you did last summer which is essentially the same movie again he co wrote halloween h but even he had the sense not to take credit for what he did on that monstrosity then comes the faculty which i can only say was god awful lots of fun to make fun of though dont even get me started on the ridiculous soap operatic dawsons creek i could rail about how bad that is for hours so then we get to teaching mrs tingle first of all there are tons of little implausibilities in this one for example in most high schools that i know of the valedictorian is not the only one who gets to go to college this idea that katie holmess character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictorian was absurd havent you ever heard of financial assistance damn it also i dont think you get expelled from high school or dont get into college because of cheating on one test there are a bunch of other ones but ill skip to the big one now the ending really bothered me they committed a crime but it was ok because the teacher was a bitch great do you know how many of my teachers i could kidnap based on that logic im sure the police never took any statements to find out the whole story either that sure wouldnt be necessary helen mirren was good she added some nice flair to a character who as a previous commenter noted had no reason for anything she did and has anyone else noticed that katie holmes absolutely cant act her self righteousness became incredibly annoying you wanted me to fail blah blah blah her last two scenes with mrs tingle were the worst the only reason i dont regret losing on this disaster is because she got beaten up a bit no wait i do regret losing the money it wasnt real and she survived mr williamson if youre reading this youve made the same movie some violence and or scary stuff offset by wise ass kids who make sarcastic jokes and references to other movies just a few too many times now i count so for not including scream and whatever follows it and i would really appreciate it if you would stop otherwise i might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a crossbow ok,negative
what was i thinking when i rented this one what did the distributor think when he copied the tape and shipped it all the way to holland that anyone really wanted to see this sits about some astronauts getting into trouble outer space apollo flashback but never even in the shadow of this fine film and they want to return to home if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possiblethis one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere deep impact and armageddon werent perfect either far from it but they were at least worth watching once and maybe one more time when were all old they gave some fun max q doesnt it gives irritation okay okay its a tv movie but does that mean youre allowed to come up with such a messif you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of timeit gets at its worst at the end when the space shuttle lands on no i cant spoil this one imdb guidelines forbid it so you have to see for yourself no dont see it sorry but rent a movie which is worth renting like battlefield earth just kiddingprobably the worst one i have ever seen,negative
another stinker from the pm entertainment group and thankfully one of their lastfiretrap is effectively a very low budgeted remake of the towering inferno i dont mind low budget b movies as long as some effort is put into them there is no effort whatsoever in firetrap is stars deansupermancain who is an absolutely terrible actor seriously he has all the acting abilities of a porn star but he turns out to be the best actor here and thats saying something the rest are just a bunch of no hopers given the boot from various daytime soaps the special fx are just rubbish shots showing the burning building from the ground are among the worst ive ever seen the fire looks like someone scribbled an orange pen at the front of the camera on top of that there is not one character you actually root for you hate everyone and hope they all die well before the minutes are upthe script is embarrassing the red herrings are signposted well in advance someone else has mentioned this but the scene where the janitor fights off a blazing fire engulfing the building with his broomhilarious or same janitor going into a room marked hazardous material were these scenes supposed to be tongue in cheek somehow i doubt itthe one good point and only one good point was there was a fair bit of action in amongst the daytime soap dramatics which kept my attention but so little care was given to everything in the film i cant recommend it watch the towering inferno instead,negative
i thought whats new scooby doo was pretty bad yes im sorry to say i didnt like it since hanna barbera didnt produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series when i heard shaggy and scooby doo get a clue was in the works i thought it could be better but when i saw a pic of how scooby and shaggy were going to appear i knew this show was going to be bad if not worse i watched a few episodes and believe me it is just yet another teen titans or loonatics unleashed wannabe no longer are scooby and shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool creepy monsters that rob banks now they are going after a typical super villain whom wants to destroy the world shaggy and scooby doo have become more brave too also since shaggy is not going to be a vegetarian in this series casey kasem whom actually is a vegetarian the original voice of shaggy will not voice shaggy he will only voice shaggy if he doesnt eat meat and that was just a stupid corporate done change to update the franchise as if the internet jokes werent enough so scott menville whom previously voiced red herring on a pup named scooby doo voices shaggy here believe me the voice is really bad it makes shaggy sound like a squeaky year old and i must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look however kasem does voice shaggys uncle albert which is a sort of good thing scooby doo on the other hand does not look that well he seems to have been designed to look more like the cgi scooby doo from the live action movies also scoobys frank welker voice need i mention brain the dog again still hasnt improved robi the robotic butler is practically worse than scrappy doo he tries to be funny and does comical impressions and gives safety tips remember kids dont stand under trees during a thunderstorm but it just doesnt fit into a scooby doo cartoon again the hanna barbera sound effects are rarely used here however on one episode lightning strikes twice they use the castle thunder thunderclaps during it almost extensively although they do still use the newly recorded thunder sound effects too scooby doo hasnt use castle thunder sound effects since but my question is why use castle thunder on shaggy and scooby doo get a clue while not use it on the direct to video movies or even on whats new scooby doo two episodes of wnsd used it and it wasnt enough unfortunately if wnsd and the dtv movies used it then they might be better than this crappy cartoon the day this show premiered i watched the first episode and it was so bad i turned it off after only five minutes to get my mind off of this poor show i rented scooby doo pirates ahoy which came out around the same time and you know what the pirates ahoy movie was actually better than shaggy and scooby doo get a clue and even better than whats new scooby doo and it looks like the new designs that the characters have isnt permanent to the franchise the direct to video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs thankfully but whether you loved or hated whats new scooby doo i dont recommend it but if you hate the old series then youll love it oh god i hope the old scooby doo cartoon stay better than this new anyways like wnsd a really bad addition to the scooby canon,negative
theyve shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it the bad acting isnt enough the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists i love the original from so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead because this one is such a bore,negative
steamboat willie is often erroneously touted as the first mickey mouse film though that title actually goes to plane crazy the source fuelling this common misconception is probably an episode of the simpsons which places the origin of itchy the mouse in a short called steamboat itchy obviously a parody of this cartoon interestingly steamboat willie was itself a parody spoofing the latest buster keaton release steamboat bill jr though the connection stretches little beyond the title and the general story setting in this walt disney short mickey mouse takes charge of a river steamboat much to the annoyance of captain pete the cat who spitefully casts him aside but mickey is not to be outdone in nastiness far removed from the pleasant wholesome mickey that more recent generations enjoyed this little mouse cares only for numero uno inflicting pain and displeasure on a series of farm animals in order to provide music for his own amusementfirst theres the laughing parrot which cops a bucket and a large potato to the head then a goat is cranked by the tail to provide music turkey in the straw from a guitar it has swallowed a cat is swung around by its tail a goose throttled about the throat and a piglet viciously booted for a childrens cartoon steamboat willie directed by walt disney and ub iwerks certainly has some mean spirited humour though i also noticed similar elements though not quite to this extent in some later disney shorts like gulliver mickey lets not forget minnie mouse of course who suffers treatment for which she could today sue for sexual harassment the jokes may be crude and the animation perhaps even more so but this cartoon delivers a bucket full of laughs and its easy to see why this little rodent became one of the most beloved characters in cinema history if youre a fan of mickey mouse or disney in general this is one steamboat you cant afford to miss,positive
i guess if you like snow boarding you may get some enjoyment from watching some nice scenery and some nice tricks but that is all the film has to offer the story line is non existent and any jokes that may have been in the film were not funny even on a sympathy level i also disliked the characters the main actor adam grimestried his best and for a comedy like this that doesnt have to be much but when surrounded by so many other bad actors he had no hope of making this film good but i shouldnt be too harsh on them for all i know they might have great skill but with a script that i could have written in ten minutes what ever skills they had were ran and hid for fear of appearing in this film my advise is dont watch it i wish i never did,negative
like the first film in this series slaughter i think it would be a mistake to just label this a blaxsploitation film sure slaughter is a tough gun toting black man but its more of an action picture regardless of the color of the leading man or the bad guys and a very good action picture at thatfor the second and final time jim brown plays the title character the film begins with one of the goofiest scenes i can remember in a film as slaughter and his friends are enjoying an outdoor party along comes a biplane and begins spraying the group with machine gun fire no slaughter isnt so tough that he then shoots down the plane with his but slaughter is ticked and no one is sure why this hit was happened however slaughter is going to get to the bottom of it well it turns out that the hit was attempted in retribution for the last movie in it slaughter takes on the mafia and kicks lots of butt down in mexico now in a horribly bungled and clumsy attempt the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people but miss slaughter and because the job was bungled so badly the mob boss ed macmahon orders the pilot and gunman killed by his brutal assassin don stroud in a very typical sort of role for him stroud is great scary and nasty to the core but ed macmahon as the boss wow thats an interesting twist slaughter is now stumped he figured out who the two guys were in the plane but by the time he got to them they were dead so to help him along in his own private vendetta brock peters who plays a cop tells him who the mobsters are who ordered the hit and got slaughter to agree to help by doing some illegal undercover work so slaughter and his pimp friend break into the mobsters mansion and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officials and naturally there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the processstroud isnt about to let slaughter get away with this and kidnaps slaughters girlfriend now its a standoff slaughter has the list but if he doesnt give it back the lady is dead being a tough but gallant man you might just be able to guess much of what happens nextthe action is very good in the film and jim brown is menacing and tough the only negative i noticed was that while having macmahon play this nasty boss at the end he simply folded and way too quickly when slaughter catches up to him macmahon becomes a wimp and all the previous nastiness disappears and this is too much of a cliché and inconsistent still despite this minor quibble its an engaging film that is not for the kids due to all the violence and boobs,positive
island of death is not really a good movie by any standard but it is a curious one imagine if natural born killers had been made years too early as a greek eurotrash porn film thats what you get here the quaint story of a young sociopathic british couple cutting a deadly swath through the population of a lovely little greek islandill spare you a detailed breakdown of the plot its not really important except to set up increasingly perverse or violent sex scenes followed by disturbingly brutal murders often lovingly photographed for posterity by our charming young couple it could have been brilliant in its own sick and nasty way but insteadinstead i found myself impatiently checking the run time and chapter index to see how much longer the parade was going to last sluggish pacing and listless bland acting turn even vilest perversities into pablum and connecting scenes into an eternity of dull plodding ah well you cant win em all,negative
this film is one to spend the short while entertainment but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything identifies the colombian who looks for the topics of the supposed colombian or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is denominated it jeopardizeit is better than it is not going to see this film some to the drug traffic or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or wing guerrilla and to the kidnapping political the corrupt police is a personage who it could be mexican russian italian or chinese and also the personage protagonist an argentine photographer it could be venezuelan peruvian or philippine and the frequent boludo in its parliaments it could be replaced by another word of slang of any other country without the personage or history changes the important thing is that it is a very decently counted history with images and right performances its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with publics bottoms a little is a classic discussion mamerta,positive

for a long time it seemed like all the good canadian actors had headed south of the border and i guessed all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comediesthis film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the viewer got back was almost true suspension of belief when the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police you almost believed it was possibleif you are a fan of some of the better sex farces canadian or not you should definitely seek this one out and the big surprise this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity,positive
just after having moved into his new cottage in the english country hercule poirot gets an invitation to dinner from sir henry and lady angkatell the owners of a large mansion nearby but the next day one of the guests is found shot near the pool and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps awaythis agatha christie mystery is somewhat thin though the killers plan is still very clever its the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level this episode mostly keeps the serious tone of five little pigs and sad cypress but contains more dark humor than them the cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point edward fox as the butler and sarah miles as lady angkatell though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful megan dodds as the ahead of her time henrietta her one on one confrontations with suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film oh and since an english police inspector does get involved in the case i think they could have brought philip jackson back for this one,positive
i watched this tape immediately rewound it watched it again and laughed twice as hard i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of but uncomfortable around transvestites it shows you that transvestitism is a feature rather than the entirety of ones being the comedy is not single issue this man is brilliant all comics should aspire to his level of candor intelligence and talent,positive
literally every aspect of this science fiction low budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors contemporaries and those to follow bad special effects a weak storyline ridiculous amounts of blood and gore annoying and pointless characters all that you can expect attack of the sabretooth is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering smilodon cats for an attraction the cats escape and begin to kill people the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the catsspecial effects wise the film is about an average achievement given its budget the sabretooths are portrayed through poor cgi amazingly though the cats look more realistic in an up close detailed shot rather than the longer more distant shots where the cgi is better concealed their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful just as youd expect they attack rip off some arms and legs and leave very little behind this is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlockthe plot and characters are just as horrendous we have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt and take it very very seriously even so much as to trespass on private property tamper with security systems and steal why are they taking a simple game so seriously did i miss something was there money involved or were they sent to do it i dont know i could barely follow the film but it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it even so they went too far for normalattack of the sabretooth is a very poor film even for a low budget sci fi flick it is a very poor and cheap example it will bore most viewers to tears might be attractive for some and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through and keep in mind this is not a comedy this is a cheap horror flick so its not suppose to be comical,negative
i am from texas and live very close to plano where the actual deaths occurred so i might be a bit biased in saying that wasted is a film that you just cant get out of your headstahl phoenix and paul all play their characters very realistically you truly believe that they are everyday high school students who just happen to be heroin addicts the drug content is handled very graphically as well although everything that happens in the film serves a purpose and each moment the characters spiral further downward is heartbreaking i definitely recommend this film to anyone once you watch it it sticks with you,positive
its a long time ago i saw this movie and still its one of the worst ive ever seen i like lots of kind of movies sci fi action drama thrillers and sometimes even horror not a combination of two this could have been a wonderful movie but they all blew it up i didnt want to see this movie but friends of mine insisted to watch it i didnt know it was such a crap i loved the first part in which clooney and tarantino drove through texas killing everybody on their way especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent but at its turning point in the titty twister bar everything changed stupid vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like nightmare on elmsteet if you like horror watch a real horror movie and when you love bloodstolling thrillers dont watch it at all you will be very disappointed at the end,negative

devils experiment hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot gee that is one lucky pizza boy and those without anal amateurs devils experiment falls solidly into the latter category it is of course the horror version of hardcore porn an almost completely plot less minute wait for the money shot shot on video in it consists of three relatively non descript japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive japanese girl the tortures range from the banal slapping her times kicking her a hundred the silly tying her to an office chair and spinning her around the fear factor a bath of maggots and sheep guts and finally the money shot a well executed eyeball piercing thats it no plot no motive just blair witch tree shots and torture the girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling no one expects the spanish inquisition during the office chair scene i was bored silly staring dumbfounded at the screen waiting for the money shot just like hardcore porn,negative
who wrote this some guy named john cohen i guess this was the first screenplay hes ever worked on someone shouldve told him youre supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might sayand who directed this scott marshal son of gerry marshall my the nut has fallen far from the tree someone might have wanted to let him know that you can in fact shoot a scene in a cab in new york and it will look real and you wont have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson but hopefully hes learned that lesson nowand jessica simpson naturally she cant act hell she makes jessica alba look like audry hepburn and yet shes starring in this movie oh wait it was produced by her father okay thats why she got the part thats really the only reason i can think ofso should i be surprised its bad no should i be amazed at how bad it is i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad but this its not just bad its the complete opposite of a classic film think of a great woody allen movie this film is as bad as that film is good its the anti annie halli am so glad i didnt pay to see it i stopped watching ten minutes in cus i couldnt go on no doubt i wouldve walked out of the theater sooner in fact i wonder how many of the people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing the film starts out laughably bad and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture and then around when the first act is ending you realize itll only get worse and thats when you either need to leave or kill yourselfin conclusion this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at guantanamo bay although some prefer the water boarding,negative
just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was if anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased i actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before ie hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff re hatchedi read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my faultsomeone said it was good no more goryhorror or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please dont bother with this movie get mary poppins now thats scary im off out now go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this little miss sunshine maybe,negative
i absolutely adore the book written by robin klein so i was very excited when i heard that a movie based on the book was in the makingbut i was severely disappointed with the movie when i did see it because it didnt capture what i loved about the book the absolutely ridiculously funny erica and the interesting way in which she views the worldfrom the start of the movie i realised that things werent the same as i had imagined in the book so i just went along for the ride it wasnt all that bad i guess miss belmont was totally different to what i had imagined her to be i didnt think she would be one to smoke and drink jean kittson who plays her is hilariouson its own i thought the movie and its actors actresses in it did a good job but alas im such a fan of the book one of my all time favourite books that i couldnt help but feel disappointed p,negative

this is the type of film that makes you question your past admiration for a particular director before you stop and remind yourself that there are very few people whose body of work doesnt contain a few clunkersthe casting in lelouchs films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer into such intimacy with the characters the actors have to bring real screen magic to live up to the intensity otherwise it is just hollow none of the actors in this film had any of that screen magic in my opinionjeremy irons and patricia kaas fell far short as the leads irons is a talented actor but he was wrong for this part lovable rogue didnt suit his strengths his brand of charm also hit a false note for me here irons persona is too decadence tinged to fit into a lelouch love storyalthough i would hesitate to pass up any opportunity to hear an english accent i also think an american actor would have worked better in this role so many of the songs that kaas sings are so closely identified with the americanness of the particular lyricist that it seemed kind of discordant to then have jeremy irons playing the love interest even though logically it really didnt matter it still screwed up the flow of the movie somehow at least for meof course it would have had to have been the right american i think george clooney would have been great in the part and he would have brought the screen magic in spades brad pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgyi was also very disappointed with patricia kaas in reading about her ive learned that she has a hugely successful career as a singer and many fans so what do i know but i found her screen presence as a singer very boring she was actually a much better actress in her speaking scenes than she was a singer in those scenes in which she had to interpret and sell a song nothing she sang moved me she was pleasant but blandin contrast someone like kate hudson who is not a professional singer and has only voice coach french still would have handled this part a million times better not to mention all that stunning french talent out there that could have been tapped into it was wrenching watching patricia kaas take up screen space when there are so many charismatic french actresses who could have been cast instead the music was so important in this film it could not really work without the music working and since kaas delivered so poorly in this respect the movie never really had a chancelelouch sealed the fate of this movie when he cast patricia kaas jmo,negative
he who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster and if you gaze for long into an abyss the abyss gazes also into youyes this is from nietzsches aphorism from beyond good and evil and thats what you find at the start of this movieif you watch the whole movie you will doubt if it was the message that the ram gopal varma production wanted to pass on as the scenes crop up one by one quite violent and at times puke raking the viewer is expected to forget the nietzsche quote and think otherwise that to deal with few people you need dedicated people like sadhu agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone not just writing firs something unworthy of the police to do as we are made to believewhen tada was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws rgvs satya did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like india within a year mcoca was passedwhen real life encounter specialist daya nayak became a monster on the path of fighting them and was himself booked by mcoca aab tak chhappan was made to heed out false impression among the people about this with its you have to be a monster to save your nation approachand people consumed it no questions raised only praises and hopes that they get a sadhu agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over blood you can ignoreevery time israel attacks palestine or lebanon we hear voices like india must also similarly attack pakistan this movie is made for such psychopaths if you dont give them this they will probably die out of boredom and lsd and what nothence this game of the passion of hatred,negative
barricade finds alice faye without any songs as a refugee trying to flee china and without passport shes in a heap of trouble i wont say what exactly and even american extraterritoriality wont help her outi mention that because one of the grievances that the chinese including the bandits who attack the american mission in this story set deep in the chinese interior was that particular institution whereby american citizens who committed crimes were tried by american courts set up by our consulates we were far from the only country doing that howeveranyway the story opens with her on a train for shanghai trying to use a hokey russian accent the accent intrigues warner baxter whos pretty plasteredbandits however interrupt the journey and the two of them seek refuge in the american consulate presided over by charles winninger hes the best one in the film and i only wish that a better story was given because i liked his character hes a widower and a proud member of the consular service appointed in by william mckinley he requested a transfer ten years later and thats the last he was heard from as assistant secretary of state jonathan hale aptly put it hes the real forgotten manbaxter does all right in a role that someone like clark gable would have done in his sleep at mgm the heroics would have come more natural to gable than to baxter as the mission is barricaded and defended against the banditsalice faye did have one number to sing why alices song was cut out god and zanuck only know one thing im still trying to figure out is when the mission inhabitants take final refuge in the cellar with a trap door just who was left upstairs to pull the rug over the cellar door barricade had the potential to be a lot better than it was but sloppy editing and lost faith in the project made th century fox release a project unfulfilled watching barricade is like eating a badly cooked meal,negative

offering a killer combo of terrible writing terrible acting and terrible direction its a tossup whether kinjite forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad its almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest seediest cannon film as if a glance at a cast list including characters like lesbian pedophile perverted gentleman porno actress werent enough its your only chance to see charles bronsons cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo but dont worry its okay as the offscreen screams make clear hes only torturing him for information after all even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter hes a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william oconnell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine but then thats what you get for telling him look i think youre a little bit unstable still when later offered a bribe he may snarl id like to shove this up your ass but i dont want to get my hands dirty hes clearly learned where to draw the line instead he just makes him eat a watch and sets fire to his cadillac the anal obsession even follows through to the films title despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set the films only direct example of kinjite forbidden subjects as alex hyde whites english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen is er talking about your bowel movements in polite societybronson isnt just too old for this as the opening fight makes only too clear hes too old for love interest peggy lipton and she looks old enough to have grown up kids a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material heres hes given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks when hes not widening the circles of suspects hes accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings hes definitely not a pc copper with a special loathing for the japanese as if it wasnt bad enough that theyre buying up american businesses whats worse they double park on a public thoroughfare no racial minority goes unassaulted be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk no cop cliché unrecycled be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye thats so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own the twin plot strands bronsons la cop trying to take down juan hernandezs pimp who deals in underage girls and james paxs porn obsessed japanese businessman take forever to intertwine and then in the most unlikely of ways after copping a feel of bronsons daughter on a bus some oriental guy touched my holy of holies in the films idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say how dya like them applessomewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is but the execution is pure rising sun the archie bunker version shot like out takes from an r rated s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot em up and blowem up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count the last of bronsons mostly bad to in different collaborations with j lee thompson and sadly thompsons last film as director its a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to,negative
what an unusual movieabsolutely no concessions are made to hollywood special effects or entertainment there is no background music not special effects or enhanced soundfacial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfirei sort of viewed these movies parts and as an educational experience not really something to go and get entertained by its quite long and in places dullbut i suspect that given the lack of any plot development i dont think its very educational eitherits also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening since for some reason the director didnt see fit to inform the audience why ches band was moving around the way they did as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot ati would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end the stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare,negative
the reviewer in variety said this was overwritten and overlong and i kind of agree with it it has some events that seem forced and unlikely like when cal crudup once again as the lost vacant and kind of dull male and julianne moore find a map of the us in kind of an unbelievable place the story is one of those s guy must find meaning in his life stories and i found myself imagining jack nicholson in his prime playing the role of cal the whole hitting the road to find meaning in life theme is still kind of interesting though does it all really lead back to family i wasnt so sure the acting is okay i particularly liked karen allen and james legross who unfortunately only have supporting roles id give it a five,negative
you have to acknowledge ciminos contribution to cinema he gave us both the most over rated film in history the deer hunter and the worst film in history heavens gate and before you start with the its bad but not the worst ever let me explain for years i listened to the critics and avoided heavens gate actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film then a few days after seeing the final cut the making and unmaking of heavens gate documentary i stumbled on a used dvd of the long version my advice after minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film you will find a wide selection and imagine that the reviewer is ciminos devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear sons movie then you will have an idea of just how big a mess cimino madewhile pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever and a classic less than zero example is its shameless distortion of history although the cattlemens association did send a group of regulators gunmen to johnson county and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated on the morning of april nick ray and nate champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about cattlemen and texas hired guns who had come to johnson county to clean out rustlers the citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested or rescued by the army women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from ray and champion there were minimal casualties after all these were sieges not assaults and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the indians and weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of johnson county residents were hanged without trial including jim averell the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife ella watson who cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows averell living to a ripe old age there is no movie making sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal perhaps it is harsh to blame cimino for his distortion of history he could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense the film provides plenty of support if cimino was insane during the production of heavens gate it would explain a lot of things but my vote goes to lack of directing talent instead of insanitythere are some good things about heavens gate you can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went expensive sets beautiful epic camera shots artful dance sequences isabelle huppert a strange casting choice that actually worked gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters the dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinarybut dont fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant like explosions of communal action this implies that there was a method to cimino madness experiments is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible the simple fact is that there is no evidence cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization what it looks like is that he just turned his dp loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots million feet of loosely staged scenes then he tried without success to pare this down and fit everything together in post production the final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen perhaps borrowed from a fiddler on the roof touring company throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly after you see this happen times you can relate to the woman the one who looks like something out of the grapes of wrath who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger this is probably what ciminos mother did after writing that reviewso believe what you have been hearing about this film since it is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess of value only as a how not to make a film example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the american west,negative
dr sayerphilippe leroy a wealthy physician with psychological issues regarding the opposite sex kidnaps an employee mariadagmar lassander a free thinking liberal woman who believes men must be the ones fixed instead of females sayer retreats to his palatial estate running maria through a humiliating series of mind games threatening to molest and kill her sayers desire it seems is to dominate her body mind and soul making her his sexual slave obeying his commands adhering to his every wish and whim after resistance at first maria slowly teeters towards his objective but has plans of her ownshe says she wishes to help sayer relinquish his sadistic behavior towards women so that he could love and not feel such yearning desires to harm it seems that sayer has her under his grip agreeing to certain rather embarrassing scenariossuch as lotioning his toes making love to a blow up doll which is a recreation of himself often spending time topless and even getting hosed down when she slaps him hard across the face bringing blood from his nosewhich almost break her but something happens as the troubled doctor slowly falls in love with mariaand through what appears to be a desperate attempt to end the madness maria gains an upper hand toying with sayers lust for her bodymore of a battle of wills a kind of sexual warfare where it seems one is in charge when in fact the other truly has the upper hand through a great deal of the film sayer mistreats maria forcing herit seemsto submit to his series of psychological games of a sexual nature her attempts to escape fail because his home is such a well designed fortressits a typical european art deco kind of palace fashioned and orchestrated by a man who has kept to this weekend retreat of his for quite a spellit features walls and doors opening at his command with an area quarantined off for his victims but once maria seemingly downs a bottle of pills as a result of her anguish at his hands the tables are turned and she has him where she wants him he finds that he actually craves her and maria uses this to her advantage playing hard to get when sayer wishes to embrace and ravage herand i could understand his frustration because she has this allure that can drive a man crazyi felt the film works ultimately as a war cry for women their empowerment and uprising against men who have the notion that they should always have control sexually and mentally the twist finalizes this ideal i couldnt swallow sayers fate because of his rigorous cardiovascular activity and exercise regimenwe see how he develops his toned athletic figure and how this regimen is part of the normal routine every weekend before the true mind games with his victim begin if he is so well fit and spends such time developing himself for the extracurricular activities which follow his regimen how could he suffer the fate which follows his finalizing the deal with maria at the end when she stops resisting his advances maria he would later admit is the first hes actually kidnapped others from the past call girls were paid for their services so that sayer could feel the power of dominating a woman even if its all a fictitious charade brought about by a deeply troubled individual with an inability to connect with the opposite sex the spontaneous decision to do so to take a leap from the norm costs him more than he could ever knowall this psycho sexual sub text is rather fascinating to see unravel but dagmar lassander such a yummy sex kitten was my reason for enjoying it sowithout her i couldnt have liked it as much because shes vital as a victim worth striving to obtain perhaps the films highlight the delicious dance as lassander clothed in gauze unravels the wardrobe exposing her breasts to a jazzy scoreits the kind of sexually seductive moment that makes your mouth water and forehead sweat dagmar lassander mustve been a joy for fashion designers because she wears those clothes so wellshe has this kind of cool a sophistication and screen presence along with her beauty and seductive powers dagmar transcends the part to create an iconic character which would define her careereven if the film isnt well knowni found about through word of mouth the provocative nature of the script and risqué subject matter might not appeal to certain crowds as it deals with sexand pain in many different forms the dialogue quite illustrative and elaborative at times i couldnt help but chuckle at sayers comments towards an imprisoned maria regarding how he enjoys making women suffer and the thrill he gets at forcing them into a type of slaveryin an attempt to make the words poetic it all feels rather hokey but dagmar is the real reason to see it and the film to me works at its best as a fetish film a possible male fantasy with this seemingly prim and proper idealist captured and held against her will forced into a precarious situation her fate possibly at the mercy of a complex and possibly dangerous masochist her submission and how she reacts towards his aggressive behavior with herthere are times where she unfolds to a wavering desire to embrace him unveiling a possible attraction towards him which in itself might startle some who watch itare among the most fascinating highlights of this exploitation feature my other favorite scene besides the dance is the piano concerto with sayer fondling maria as she plays a soothing melody,positive
oh dear jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game and hes way out of his league the script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as michael dudikoff s action bmovie king michael jai white last seen in the sci fi flop spawn as well as surviving the games william macnamara who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film stoop this low for employment if you are a fan of jerry then stick to his tv show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half after i had finished sitting through this i managed to catch the last half an hour of rocky on tv which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison i think that says more than enough,negative
totally brain dead actioner made in the philippines this belongs to the mode of filipino movies which tried to pass themselves as american films on the international market after a rather dull beginning the movie takes off and never disappoints again it is actually a rip off of the worst movies chuck norris ever made an american prisoner in vietnam is brainwashed by the soviets who implant a microchip in his brain so he is programmed to kill the pope then the president of the usa one of his old buddies played by b movie stalwart max thayer is sent to stop him utterly ridiculous action scenes putrid acting nick nicholsons performance as the evil soviet commander is a must seeand implausible plot make up for one of the cheesiest action pictures ever bestowed in the general public,negative
much like final fantasy if you look at a still shot it doesnt look so bad but when the people start moving its utterly horrifying uneven jerky motions frightening lack of emotion and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps the characters do not even appear alive organici saw a preview screening with my daughter who actually fell asleep she was not at all engaged for the record i thought her to be easily engaged by both pixar esque films as well as a number of the bad d films like sinbadthe lighting is painful giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire the lip syncing is bad worse actually than final fantasy i also seriously question having hanks play five characters this was a major distraction throughout the film the role of the conductor is eerie although in a way i just cant pinpoint it reminds me of my fathers fake phone voice when greeting clientsi think this is why the multiple roles are distracting you are accutely aware that the voice is the same but yet distinctly different it gives each character the feel of being acted as opposed to being real human characters the illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of hanks ive seen the technique work a la eddie murphy but hanks just cant come close to pulling it off with a voice alone given the horrifying animationi would not waste my money on this wait for the rental,negative
considering the potential this move had the reality was disappointing while its always nice to see jennifer aniston in a movie even that couldnt turn this around most of the action was predictable the jokes were flat to mildly amusing and the characters were not very interesting i wanted to like this film but it just never happened ben stiller was hilarious in theres something about mary here it looks like hes just going thru the motions if they have to lift plot points from friends they should have known something was wrong the toilet humor should have stayed in the closet watch first dates instead,negative

this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful a beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film many changes have been made to the storyline presumably to streamline the timeframe but what results is simply confusing the acting cant possibly overcome the script which removes the characters motives for their behavior plus the conversion to english does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch esteban as esteban horrible please please please read the gorgeous novel in spanish if possible dont see this film it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience,negative

cheezy yep poorly filmed you betcha zero budget they proudly claim it on their posters brilliant anyway or because of it for surethis movie celebrates and makes fun of everything that was classic about the s teen horror genre characters with absolutely no depth fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent completely gratuitous nudity impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims slow moving zombies great one liners and our hero even wears a michael jackson jacket this is not an all out spoof like scary movie but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the s horror movies when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun silly sexy and goofy good time,positive
out of people found this comment useful and countingpeople are such suckers for image and looks as much as for the intellectually hollow idealism that lurks behind communism ches charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda such as this movie about himi dont know whats worse being captured by one of ches murder squads or having to sit through hours of this typically soderberghian garbage the question isnt why this pet project was made but what took them so long by them im referring of course to left wing hollywood and its secret love of marxist tyrants lenin castro take your pick i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltowns least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project where was oliver stone all these years robert redford tim robbins warren beatty alan pakula george clooney barbra streisand even its a mystery all these overrated artists have often indulging themselves in similar politically one sided projects yet somehow che guevara who is arguably the most popular and well known communist hasnt been a film topic of theirs yetguerrilla has all the hallmarks of an american truth bending story of an epic scale there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big budget political fairy tale bios such as malcolm x or gandhi ie almost none the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary nevertheless however controversial and criminal this mans actions may have been one thing nobody could take away from him he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family which is why del toro fits the bill only visually del toro may be an interesting charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive casting such mediocrities as bratt philips and franka incompetente only underlines the directors lack of sound judgmentthe movie is to the most part extremely slow no surprise there and visually uninteresting even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the hour mark so its quite telling that this soderbergh who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task if you think the films length indicates that a bulk of ches life has been shown here then think again soderbergh focuses on ches last phase and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense full of guevaras alleged idealism psychopaths dont have ideals i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of ches earlier life did he actually consider it too uninteresting a massacre of people holds no interest for the viewer huh amazing some much better directors than this over praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a hour moviesoderbergh in a sense becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative dark side which is more than of guevara by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy consciously ignoring the ugly truth god forbid he should taint the holy image of che soderbergh proves himself not a humanist a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold but the opposite that he cares only about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested like on guinea pigs soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind such people often have a latent contempt for the proleteriat what a stupid term theyre supposedly siding withhalf of all students around the world wear ches image on their red and orange shirts but without ever knowing why he has become an iconic figure for clueless uninformed very often young people who think that by having this mans face on their chest that somehow makes them appear edgy intellectual hip or interesting in reality wearing a che shirt only underlines ones overall shallowness and total disinterest in self education wouldnt you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his her face to the world wearing ches by now cliché image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup all those che wearers probably know more about marges blue hair than theyll ever read up on about fidel castros dead allyafter everything thatd been done in the name of marx one would think that these mongrel ideals would be finally laid to rest it seems mankind will never learn stalin mao kim il pol pot castro milosevic ceausescu the iron curtain a hundred million dead more than a billion

veber is not renown for his outstanding directorial skills in fact nobody cares as long as they got the laughs quite a few here to be honest scattered in the whole process thanks to depardieus half wit characterization and the dialogue veber puts in his mouthbut this is not enough to make a great comedy since theres no movie outside of the usual veber premise a tough guy is doomed to team up with a very naive character in lemmerdeur la chvre or les compres there was a real story going on over the fire vs water proceedings le diner de cons although it was a play managed to create a real suspense about the next catastrophe pinon would cause in tais toi the backstory about the vengeance is both redundant and too weak to arouse our interest plus the heavies are lame both on screen and in the scriptnow whats wrong veber wraps this up creating no action no rhythm instead he uses systematically and overuses ellipses maybe he met william goldman in hollywood and the music really stresses that lack of nerve and a backbone in the storyso youll have to be content with depardieus performance,negative
i absolutely loved this movie great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also the calm understated manner of the lead character franta makes him very likable the human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time the bond between franta and carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans the subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the czech pilots had in the raf the postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of ww did not end in especially in russian occupied countries the cinematography was also very good wish i could have seen it on the big screen,positive
based on the book space vampires by colin wilson this is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of sci fi horror to come out of the eighties the effects done by ilm still hold up by todays standards the actors are mostly british and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realism the film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic tobe hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for its low takings but for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and well paced plot not to be over looked,positive
beware my lovely came on tv on bbc recently during the early hours so i set the video to record it and was pleased i dida man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he dont get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widows house but she does not know what she is taking on here it turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer he starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar he then cuts the phones line so she cant get help from the outside a young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isnt quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off eventually the man leaves acting as if nothing has happenedi can see why beware my lovely was given an x certificate when released in the cinemas some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time i also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy toothe cast features an excellent performance from robert ryan as the psychopath ida lupino as the widow and are joined by barbara whiting and dee pollock as the boythis is certainly robert ryans most chilling performance ive seen a must seerating stars out of,positive
i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing kitamura rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket azumi picks up where azumi left off however these are completely different movies the pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise if that is possible i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off even the real bad guys get killed off too easily without too much of a fight the fight with the spider guy straight out of an episode of monkey in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene wheras in azumi we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects azumi brought us the azumi cape cam azumis rampage at the end was unconvincing but aya still does an okay job she looks great in the capebut where did she get it from i dont think i will be watching this one over and over again what a pity,negative
this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary,negative
i rarely comment on films but ive read the other comments and i cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish i know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit poorly acted badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along i am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want all i can say is it is a terrible film the content is poor and offensive the production is amateurish and i am glad they could not make a film like this legally today,negative
i went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations i went with my girlfriend and two friends and none of them could explain the story of the grudge to me well if the first one couldnt leave an impression on them to explain the plot then i doubted this one would be any betterlet me summarize what the trailers let you know the asian lady is back and so is sarah michelle gellar luckily for her she isnt around very long that decision may have saved her careerthe movie has three story lines and none of them make sense and even worse none of them are developed you almost start to understand and then someone dies and the story gets left behind okay killing people could be scary but i was left more confused over the attempted plot development than i was frightened they jump back and forth between all three story lines which arent related or are they sound effecttt the timing of the three stories are displaced and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end be prepareddd oh wait sorry this isnt a fight club or vertigo quality twist you could see this one coming from miles away and probably envisioned a much better twist in your head they shouldve hired me instead of the girl making her surprising appearance maybe it couldve been michael jackson instead that part of scary movie scared the crap out of methe killing sequences were terribly done unlike horror movies of the past where a killer pops out of nowhere a closet or behind a door for example and everyone in the theatre jumps and subsequently the fat guy behind you spills popcorn down your neck this lacked any frightening pop ups they zoomed in on where the random asian woman or kid would show up and you knew exactly what was coming instead of having the music get really loud then quiet then a pop out to psyche you out the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene if i know its coming it wont scare methe movie began with explaining what the grudge is when a person is killed during a fit of rage a curse is placed on the location where she was killed so why does the asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story and why is the grudge now moving countries this movie was absolutely terribleall it did was leave me begrudging my friends for making me go we shouldve seen one of those animated pixar movies it wouldve been scarier,negative
i dont know if this exceptionally dull movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to the french connection but it does have many of the same drawbacks the script is so confusing that the viewer remains uninvolved and feels left out of the picture and the direction is so cold so lacking in energy that even the great chase sequence cant liven things up,negative
ok well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ok the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into then the one with the boy was completely retarded it wasnt even scary his dream sounds like a little kids bedtime story then the news girls one was completely retarded too im sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you but that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on tv and he said all that junk to her next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead peopleomg its so stupid im not even going to say any more about itthe last one was the best it wasnt that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cooluh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something then when theyre all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus to hell ahahahah and they see all the people from their dreams on the busha the end,negative
this movie just happened to be on hbo yesterday so i watched it this was a mistake i guess i got sucked in and kept watching although it was a lot like a train wreck terrible horrible but somehow you just cant look away shaudenfraud i guess this is the story of a photoshoot for models on some island in the caribbean one by one they are all murdered one drinks cleaning fluid one gets blown up on a waverunner one goes over a cliffso these are not accidents but for some inane reason the police are never called and no one thinks that perhaps they should wrap the shoot and go home not just in respect for the dead but perhaps out of fear for their own lives no they just continue with their shoot because that is whats most important forget about the dead models we have a magazine to produceone of the subplots is the evil magazine owner played by lee majors rex is his name he is the most obvious suspect and every time a model gets killed he twirls his mustache and says well i cant say this wont be good for sales mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha so absurd another subplot is when its revealed that rex is one of the models baby dady only when he learned of the baby he tried to convince the girl to abort she didnt but always resented him for even suggesting thisthey try to give you false clues and point toward some guy named raule seemingly because hes the only one with an accent and looks creepyat the very end sorry to spoil but this movie came out years ago so if you havent seen it by now one of the women was found face down dead in the pool this was the last straw vanessa angel forget her characters name comes at rex with a gun they struggle the gun fires and now shes dead too while shes laying on the floor his business associate tells him that with all this bad press the magazine will be worthless and its all his fault he gets him to sign over the magazine to him once he does voila all the dead models come back to life and you find the entire thing was an elaborate ruse to get back at rexoy what a ridiculous movie as someone else said if you want to see something like this april fools day is far better,negative
after hoo hooing american indians scalp number one son frontiersman bruce bennett as daniel boone seems at first like he wants to get even but he really wants to make friends with the natives when sad eyed indian chief lon chaney jr as blackfish also loses number one son it gets more difficult to clear up misunderstandings apparently this was republic pictures attempt to do for their daniel boone trail blazer what disney studios had successfully done with davy crockett king of the wild frontier the danl boone song whistled and sung by a group of children in a wagon did not follow fess parkers davy crockett up the hit parade singer faron young as faron callaway doesnt perform the title song perhaps wisely he does sing long green valley and makes a good impression as a blond boyfriend for boones daughter but spanish actor freddy fernandez is the films most valuable player in a cute scene mr fernandez reminds mr young the name of the character susannah he is supposed to be in love with daniel boone trail blazer ismael rodríguez bruce bennett lon chaney jr faron young freddy fernandez,negative
in a world where humans can live forever you spend the entire movie wishing they would die first off if you insist on watching this movie do two things first put it on mute dont worry you miss a plot hell they dont even talk for the first min of an min movie after putting on mute you must now hit fast forward till the main chick dies dont worry even if your paying attention you wont know why or how she died once you get to the good part take it of mute oh how will you know the good part wait for an elevator scene with two morons in space suits with wwii weapons these weapons wont seem like much till you realize that the first protagonist had a laser tag pistol and a bandoleer of co cartridges the only remnants of a plot take place between a glowing ball and a semi hot chick who looks like she was attacked by wolverine after listening to the plot you will wish they went back to not talking of the four people that are in this movie none of them can remotely act not even a little bit you will have better luck witnessing acting at a kindergarten theaterto comment on the special on the special effects let me just say wow no really you will spend the entire movie saying to your self where did this movies million dollar budget go seriously it will leave you in aw of the magnitude of ineptness the best sets are basically windows wallpaper backgrounds the ships are basically flying wrenches wait some are barges that kinda look like whales i have never heard so many made up words in my whole life they have buttons on their wristlarge pedometers that can put them in fight mode and super runing mode makes them super blurry this will seriously drain their power reserves but they find bits of wires to chew on to regain their strength the explosions were less impressive than my fourth of july i only had sparklersso the plot as far as i can figure goes something like this mother is a space ship captain and goes to the desert for a while rides a rocket dies then her daughter years in the future no i am not exaggerating recalls her mothers memories through some sort of capsule anyways they jabber on for another min and then the cause a big bang yes the same big bang that started our solar system its explained how she goes back in time or something it does not really matter it happened i guess roll credits seriously the whole script was mercifully on one sheet of paper unless that actually detailed any of the dreadfully fight scenesafter watching the credits i have now laughed more than i did the entire movie the jobs the created like catering supervisor galactius sarcophagus and then the special thanks to george lucas was just the besti really wasnt expecting that much for a movie i paid cents for but seriously some body owes me for this most frequent comment heard after the movie i want my life back you have to admire that some but put time and effort in to this movie but seriously why,negative
i didnt buy this i didnt rent this it was on ppv and someone burned a copy of it and loaned it to me so at least i wasted no money on it for someone that did darkness the nameless devils backbone this is a pretty lame film seems to have something to do with a bunch of girls that were at a convent back in the day and now theyre all grown up and theyre being pursued and killed one by one by a nun that comes out of the kitchen sink the toilet and even manages to negotiate the revolving doors in a hotel and what makes this nun so mean and nasty and wet i dunno this was so boring that at some point about halfway through i just stopped it put it away and watched something else wasnt even interested in finding out really oh sure theres some lovely young ladies to look at but hey are two of them lesbians i guess theres a picture on the bedside table of one young ladys bedroom and what self respecting horror movie wouldnt be complete these days without a lesbian couple yeah whatever out of if you want to see a worthwhile nun horror movie try desecration dead waters or the convent and thats the one with adrienne barbeau by the way not the one with john malkovich,negative
i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next clerks but left feeling let down the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat that isnt to say it was all bad the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material but the director switched focus to the cliched save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot he would have come out with a much more memorable movie now to do the film justice i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed webster in fact the best kevin smith of clerks homage here was giving props to his hometown webster ny is to checkout what red bank nj is to clerks the director wisely threw in a date at nick tahous trust me as far as things to do in rochester a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated them,negative
from a plot and movement standpoint this movie was terrible i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after long minutes that it mercifully did basically five characters appear in the movie a son father sons girl friend and two male characters of the sons age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation the movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo eroticism but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another there were a couple of brilliant scenes at the beginning of the movie the sons girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation the photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two ending with her admitting to having another man who was older end of that story,negative

i ordered this movie on the internet as it is very difficult to get turkish movies where we live ive heard so much about the tv series from my friends and practically everyone in turkey i was expecting to see a breakthrough in turkish cinema what a disappointmentme and my husband who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of turkish landscape and turkish dialogues in it only watched it all the way through because we had paid for the dvd well that was a boring way of wasting itit was confusing at times overacted whereas other times underacted the storyline was not only confusing but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it hollywood didnt also work for methe american characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned the turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant the camera movements had no significance adding a few dervishes never seen in them in kapadokya by the way and broken plates greek style only made the movie even more confusing i am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it there are surely worthy movies made by turkish directors which deserve more attention and respecti give this movie out of,negative
theres really not a lot to say about las vegas lady its harmless enough but it is little more than a dull heist film from the s the movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be the plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline thats been done to death except in the case of las vegas lady i think the robbery plot was designed by a year old the plan involves three women one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the circus cicus building one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage thats pretty much it intricate huh other than stella stevens and her aforementioned breasts the other women involved in the plot arent particularly memorable las vegas lady co stars stuart whitman when not pawing stevens his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on filmi really wanted to like this movie it does have that s feel to it that i always enjoy and some nice shots of las vegas circa but the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a and thats probably overstating it in the end las vegas lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage,negative
i would just like to say that no matter how low budget the film is it needs to be shown throughout this world the point to these movies we dont read that much anymore instead people want to see movies having this series out on dvd has made me want to read the whole series and want more please make all movies please dont change any of the characters either it ruins the effect because i have grown to love the actors who have played the characters please make all movies i want to see the message and watch the message that these books and now movies are here to portray we dont get that enough anymore awesome job,positive
slow but beautifully mounted story of the american revolution griffiths story telling seems a lot less heavy handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action lionel barrymore is an utter swine neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is well carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period but she doesnt show up often enough to slow the pace and dramanote that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than hours when first released but that no cut exists that runs longer than minutes however the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hoursfar better in terms of story telling than sound versions such as the patriot while not quite in the league of griffiths best such as way down east and broken blossoms an excellent way to spend a couple of hours,positive
the evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture all inside what a washout of a movie theres not a single scary scene not one richard crenna overplays a nothing role theres some animated ghosts a disfigurement by power saw and a ghost rape after nothing special happens for almost the whole movie the evil gets personified intovictor buono great where did the filmmakers get the idea that buono is scary he looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his liquor bill by then its too late to turn it off because the damn thing is over i felt like throwing the videocassette out the window please avoid this junk hopefully it will never see the light of dvd and will fade into obscurity,negative
staten island filmmaker andy milligan is well known in the horror community for being an even worse director than ed wood and with this as a dim example of his output im apt to agree with them in the ghastly ones we basically have three bickering couples traveling to their childhood home located on a conveniently secluded island to collect an inheritance there they are killed off one by one and the events unfold in murder mystery fashion with a scarred retard hunchback butler added to throw you for a loop the film is in such bad shape that it looks like someone just ran it through a dishwasher the sound is terrible the dialog is otherworldly bad theres some primitive mannequin gore plus some dismemberments and guts and its technically inept in every possible way it can be inept but is it enjoyable in a bad movie kind of way sort of its excruciating to watch but oddly entertaining in a train wreck fashion approach with caution if youre not a fan of horrible movies better deep six this one,negative
the chipmunk adventure there are some movies that i could watch all my life and never grow tired of them and this nostalgic favorite is one of them the chipmunk adventure was a attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation this time on the big screen in an age when disney dominated the film industry in terms of animation quality and box office the chipmunk adventure stands as one of the best animated films that disney didnt produce in the sthe story is simple and elementary having alvin simon theodore compete in an around the world race with the chipettes janette eleanor brittany however as the chipmunks encounter exotic dangers they are unaware that they are the pawns in a major diamond heistthe chipmunk adventure never was and never will be a film that soars thanks to an engrossing plot and to people who didnt love it as a child the film will probably never be more then an enjoyable yet forgettable animated movie but for me it will always be a little known masterpiece something about the film just clicks for me in a way few films doevery song is fun upbeat and harmless highlights include the chipettes in a slightly risqué arabian dance to calm snakes theres also a very sweet song in which the chipmunks sing about traveling the world and we get to see them at major landmarks throughout the globe one thing about the chipmunk characters is that despite the potentially annoying vocals the songwriters always managed to write songs that were catchy without ever being grating this film is no exception it actually boasts one of the best animated movie soundtracks of the s if you ask meevery joke is cute sincere and amusing the bits between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing and the shock of seeing the chipettes nearly forced into marriage by a child emperor is as well the comedy manages to constantly play to the kids so that they dont miss anything but everything remains charming for the adults with enough nostalgia to keep them entertainedits really just a fun trip that is completely humble in its ambitions the chipmunk adventure never aims to be anything more then it is harmless fun ill be the first to admit this is a biased review because i have such a nostalgic fondness for the chipmunk adventure that i would never be able to give it a bad review but nonetheless it fills me with such a childish contentment while watching it everyone has their random favorite from childhood that no one knows and for me its this movie and any film that i can watch over and over whether i am or older is a great film in my eyes a,positive
i saw the last five or ten minutes of this film back in or one night when i was channel surfing before going to bed and really liked what i saw since then ive been on the lookout scouring tv listings flipping through dvd vhs racks at stores but didnt find a copy until recently when i found out some internet stores sold it then being a world class procrastinator i still didnt order it finally i found a dvd copy in a circuit city while visiting portland or a few weeks ago then it only took me about a month after returning home before sitting down and watching itso what do i think about the film its good not as good as i remembered and hoped for but still well worth the it cost me after seeing the whole film for the first time i rate it as a with potential to become an ill have to be less sleepy then and have a better sound system to avoid rewinding to catch some dialogue,positive
this movie is a riot i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in the movie was non stop until the end when they did the minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all inas far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great its not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got a year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed shes not a like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbiteif you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it i assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre onesoh and one more thing i hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list this means you ebert,positive

there are many mysteries in life for example why did any of the people other than carrot top agree to appear in this movie why did anyone distribute this movie why did anyone pay money to see it i guess none of these questions will ever be answered but one thing i know for sure this movie is one of the worst ever made with a budget this big it would already be bad but the addition of carrot tops humor makes it even worse the only entertainment one could possibly get from this movie is to burn it smash it or otherwise destroy it in an amusing fashion if you were to rank it against every movie ever made it would be right between problem child and biodome nuff said,negative
this home movie is basically scandalously rubbish but you have to give them for trying the blood is rubbish but the granny that kills them is quite funny and i think the concept is good and make up is ok for a home movie however thank god it was only minutes long and the twist at the end is quite literally fight club as in almost as trash as the film just read this comment dont watch the film,negative
every movie quentin tarantino has made has become progressively worse id like to believe that most people would agree with that statement but seeing as inglourioussic basterdssic has an from over ratings it doesnt seem like the general movie going public has any sense even his best work reservoir dogs wasnt a masterpiece the trouble is that claiming that you like tarantinos work has become trendy as soon as that happens you get boatloads of people ready and willing to hop on another bandwagon they will ignore laughably terrible acting and utterly self indulgent writing just so they can be part of the exclusive club called everyone this movie is so terrible that i swear it must be some sort of twisted joke by tarantino to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him like another reviewer has already said previous tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies this one is from a guy in love with his own writing i couldnt agree more this movie is nothing more than self indulgent and in joke riddled writing paired with acting ability taken right out of a high school play but thanks to the general movie going public im sure it will still go down as one of the best movies ever made bravo tarantino youve pulled off one of the best practical jokes of all time,negative
i really liked the first part of this film in africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty by civilized humans in scotland got to me in the second half and made me so sad i couldnt watch some of it however this was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early natural scientists ruined everything alive they didnt understand by studying it literally to death without considering the rights and comfort of the animals studied which we know now shouldnt be studied anywhere but in the natural world they inhabit and as unobtrusively as possible i do recommend this film as it was a mostly serious and honest story of tarzan and made a point of showing the gross animal cruelty that was rampant in the th century scientific world as well as the pure and simple beautifully primitive life tarzan lived as a young man who was found as a baby and raised by chimps after the violent death of his parents in the african junglechristopher lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of tarzan role as was ralph richardson in his last film role as tarzans ultra rich nobility reeking gramps in scotland andy macdowell was pretty and pretty good as tarzans gussied up and civilized jane in her first movie role from his charismatic work in this film and his very haunting eyes i cannot understand why lambert did not later become a big star but his really bad movie choices later may have done him in the terrific ian holm as a wounded frenchman in africa helped by tarzan and who then escorted tarzan back to his previously unknown ancestral home in scotland was great as alwaysi am so glad tarzan got sick of and didnt stay in the animal cruel civilized world at that time and went home to africa in the end to live out his life with his gentle and loving ape relatives who raised him instead of staying in scotland and living like royalty which would have ruined him if it didnt kill him first,positive
i was searching through hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the new years weekend as i was looking through the shelves severed spotted my eye and i grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent b grade horror movie the cover looked fairly good the plot sounded semi interesting so i rented it what a mistake dont be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent im thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself the film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired ritualistic serial killer called the head hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably los angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murderstory sound somewhat good well it is and this movie couldve been halfway decent but good god it was bad almost everything about it was laughable the opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial sound ridiculous yep you bet it is the entire movie looks like it was filmed on a vhs quality camera and im assuming it was the acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable and the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someones bathroom everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didnt hold my interest for very long and i often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography the pacing was bad everything was just badoverall severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent b movie the plot was good and i think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it couldve been alright but this movie fell flat on its face if youre expecting something semi decent youll be sorely disappointed only recommended if you can tolerate d grade horror flicks otherwise youll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage it had a little potential but it was beyond a mess,negative
between the ages of and when he died of a brain tumour zachary scott made films he was introduced in in jean negulescos the mask of dimitrios where he played dimitrios the next year he made three films of which this is one he is best remembered by cineastes as the star of jean renoirs the southerner one of the films where he had a sympathetic role however he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a sociopathic killer of women for money so what happens here he lives in a house with three women so watch out faye emerson who also appeared in dimitrios plays the older of two daughters in the house she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged then her cute kid younger sister played effectively by mona freeman who resembles bonita granville both in looks and in behaviour returns from boarding school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a tidy sum so scott turns his sights on her instead with all the torrid jealousies seething in the household which that was bound to arouse things get tense and then they get tenser meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the calculating scott but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story james wong howe gives effective noirish cinematography to this tale which was directed by frenchman robert florey who had moved to hollywood some time earlier the film is an effective psychopath in the house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an inclination,positive
when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is undeniable however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must congratulate the translator because the english sub titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd,negative
the comeback starts off looking promising with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer the mask itself is pretty cool too and looks almost identical to the one used in the s slasher film granny from then on the film is mostly boring we get a few more deaths which again are good but theres not enough of them the reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody the story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part i would avoid this unless youre a die hard collector theres not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick,negative
if you are looking for a modern film version of buster crabbe or johnny weismullers overcoming the machinations of unscrupulous white safari guides or cunning black tribesmen while saving the animal kingdom this is not the movie for you this is a recounting of the tarzan legend from its beginning in intelligent adult terms it is beautifully filmed and faithful to the edgar rice burroughs storiestarzan is no action hero but a man torn between two worlds the natural and the civilized in a stunning performance christopher lambert portrays this angst with absolute realism if he slips up just once the cat will be out of the bag the audience especially the adult audience targeted by the film will laugh and the film will completely lose its grip it will plummet into the cheesy depths but lambert never lets that happen forget what you may think of him in other movies when i saw this film at the theater on its original release i thought he deserved an academy awardthe supporting cast is uniformly excellent as other commentators have noted i disagree with most of them in that i didnt find anything wrong with andie mcdowells performance i wouldnt have nominated her for an academy award the role is undemanding but she is completely up to it such as it is i dont know why her voice was overdubbed eitherthe cinematography of the african segment of the tale is absolutely beautiful it captures both the beauty of the african wilderness and the exotic expectation it holds in the collective imagination of those who have never been there the scenery is lush and exotic and the colors are vividbut this is also a period film and the cinematography also magnificently depicts victorian england the countryside the city and the interiors the costumes are outstanding the soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or obtrusivethere are some disturbing scenes especially for animal lovers but no more disturbing than a few scenes in dances with wolves this is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature personified in the young lord greystoke convincingly portrayed by christopher lambert,positive
this movie was heavily marred by the presence of steven seagal or as i should say steven so dull like before seagal is either too good or too stupid to re dub his own lines leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped a few films before this was he has done this too but i dont think to this extent to be honest the film looks pretty good the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie of course all told this film is pretty badit would have been much better without seagal who has become a cartoon of himself dont bother anything over a buck for this one is too much i honestly think this is the last time for me and a seagal film whats taken me so long to realize this,negative
the summary provided by my cable tv guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is slaughterhouse rock is by far the worst horror film that i have ever seen a title previously held by urban legends final cut from its opening scene i could tell its going to be really bad but i was so bored that i couldnt care less this film contains laughable acting especially by the guy whos tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the crappiest music ive heard and im living in a period when the likes of britney spears and nsync dominate the air waves the biggest problem with slaughterhouse rock is that its not funny one would a film as dull and boring and so not scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one liners here and there but no we have tormented guys self centered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler and please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night no one if youre going to make a horror movie at least make it believable this one is anything but,negative
i had fun watching red eye its not a masterpiece but its well directed and structured cillian murphy and rachel mcadams are perfect in the role yes its the same old story with a different setting but wes craven gave it a good pace at least not another scream with the usual college killer its nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesnt stand out as its main character particularly from a film maker like craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good tv movie had it not been released theatrically good job,positive
visitor q is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the worlds most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter etc the film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following however with home video quality and a slapdash production visitor q just doesnt hold up even as a curiosity genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible make up is awful and everything else is amateurish at best a waste of time c,negative
i would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie if at one point or another you thought youve seen good camera work be prepared to be amazed by this movie for the record this movie was made in in russia but the technique used here is probably something that weve seen much later in the western worldabout years later the level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot happiness love war despair joy but in the end you remain with something quite unique the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking the young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similareven though i think movies like this are very hard to come by if youve seen i am cuba then this movie would appeal to you very much but if not be prepared for a unique experience the russian directors have something in common very small budgets great actors and a joy of creating artand yes they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together i am not a big fan of russia actually i hate everything thats communist but the film making in that part of the world manages to create such feelings that are hard to describeenjoy it,positive
without a doubt this is the worse comicbook movie every made period yes its worse then dolph lundgrens punisher yup worse then the captain america movies oh yeah its even worse then christopher reed scripted superman iv quest for peace movie sheeshh that movie was so bad that the guy who played nuclear man only starred in one other film and it was only on tv opthis movie is d quality i had a chance to watch it on the scifi channel back in i had heard it was pretty bad but had nothing else to do that night so i figured i check it out what a waste of an hour and a half i would have been better off watching reruns of different strokes besides having the lamest special effects and worse acting ive ever seen the whole script was just awful and not well directed at all thankfully a new fantastic four movie is being done and hopefully this version will do the heroes justice i was hoping for a new spawn movie in the future but it has yet to materialize do not rent this movie if you happen to see it being televised on cable check it out be warned though youll most like be flipping the channel after the first mins,negative
the hindi version of the film is minutes set in bengal in the early s the film based on tagores novel draws an analogy between the british colonization of india and the subjugation of women an educated and beautiful woman binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society the film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps aishwarya rai is out of her depth in portraying binodinis strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness binodinis idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried,positive
this film was terrible i thought it would be ok but it just got worse and worse from the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable rom com but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates none of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was tom although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while the dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely non existent in an insulting attempt at comedy the writer director introduces a new character or event in practically every scene none of which are realistic making it very confusing to keep track of what is going on the plot is barely an excuse for a movie guy likes girl house sits fathers home to get to know girl destroys house gets girl a complete waste of time,negative

jane austens emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen kake beckinsales emma is irreproachable gwyneth paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make emma likeable paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply wrong for the part and i believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses kate beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly the most romantic of jane austens heroes actually sees in her mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful,positive
george p cosmatos rambo first blood part ii is pure wish fulfillment the united states clearly didnt win the war in vietnam they caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers the only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen the character of rambo is perfect to notice this he is extremely patriotic bemoans that us americans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians like every film that defends the war eg we were soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in south asia and for that matter also the reason for every single us american soldier that was there instead rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation it would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them do we get to win this time yes you do,negative

this movie makes canadians and brits out to be asinine moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story i do not understand what they are there for they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle apparently canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks its the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies beforeevery character here is a carping infantile stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with george wendt shudder is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted hereas for the rest of the plot the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back yawn or karl who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcocks masterpiece although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifyingby the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat,negative
i was just looking at the bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i havent yet and i found this little screen gem one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it darn well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it it has been awhile however i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i havent seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them i think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a b movie it is really good i dont know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those,positive
yes indeed it could have been a good movie a love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not a triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical its a picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious,negative

this film is about a deadly poison that is contained in small glass globes that is used to kill this is apparently done to hide an espionage ring intent on stealing plans for a new american bomber now much of this plot was repeated in other chan films the jade mask and the docks of new orleans additionally it was first used in mr wong detective all had the exploding glass globes a plot element that obviously has been overused it was interesting in murder over new york but by these later films it was rather passéfortunately the rest of the film was fresh and the plot worked out very well with a nifty conclusion where of course the culprit reveals himself however no plane could fly the way this one did especially in such extreme dives and rapid ascents were pretty silly out of this already obsolete planeby the way in a small role as a porter youll see frank coghlan jr the same actor who played billy batson in the captain marvel serial according to imdb mr coughlan is years old and retired from the film industry,positive
i must admit a slight disappointment with this film i had read a lot about how spectacular it was yet the actual futuristic sequences the age of science take up a very small amount of the film the sets and are excellent when we get to them and there are some startling images but this final sequence is lacking in too many other regardsmuch the best drama of the piece is in the mid section and then it plays as melodrama arising from the high concept science fiction nature of it all and insufficiently robust dialogue there is far more human life in this part though with the great ralph richardson sailing gloriously over the top as the small dictator the boss of the everytown i loved richardsons mannerisms and curt delivery of lines dismissing the presence and ideas of raymond masseys aloof confident visitor this boss is a posturing convincingly deluded figure unable to realise the small fry nature of his kingdom its not a great role yet richardson makes a lot of iteverytown itself is presumably meant to be england or at least an english town fairly representative of england interesting was the complete avoidance of any religious side to things the things to come seem to revolve around a conflict between warlike barbarism and a a faith in science that seems to have little ultimate goal but to just go on and on there is a belated attempt to raise some arguments and tensions in the last section concerning more personal life yet one is left quite unsatisfied the film hasnt got much interest in subtle complexities it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle blunt moralism every time and of course recall the hedged bet finale raymond massey waxing lyrical about how uncertain things are concerning the question of the film being a prediction i must say its not at all bad as such considering that one obviously allows that it is impossible to gets the details of life anything like right the grander conceptions have something to them a war in well that was perhaps predictable lasting nearly years mind a nuclear bomb the super gun or some such contraption in a technocratic socialist we dont believe in independent nation states type government in britain after hmmm sadly nowhere near on that one chaps no real politics are gone into here which is a shame all that surfaces is a very laudable anti war sentiment generally it is assumed that dictatorship whether boneheaded luddite fascist as under the boss or all hands to the pump scientific socialism will be the deal and these implications are not broached while we must remember that in there was no knowledge at all of how nazism and communism would turn out or even how they were turning out the lack of consideration of this seems meek beside the scope of the filmmakers vision on other mattersmuch of the earlier stuff should and could have been cut in my opinion only the briefest stuff from would have been necessary yet this segment tends to get rather ponderous and it is ages before we get to the richardson massey parts i would have liked to have seen more done with margareta scott who is just a trifle sceptical cutting a flashing eyed mediterranean figure to negligible purpose the character is not explored or frankly explained or exploited except for one scene which i shall not spoil and her relationship with the boss isnt explored but then this was the s and there was such a thing as widespread institutional censorship back then edward chapman is mildly amusing in his two roles more so in the first as a hapless chap praying for war only to be bluntly put down by another massey character massey himself helps things a lot playing his parts with a mixture of restraint and sombre gusto contrasting well with a largely diffident cast save for richardson and scott and chapman slightlyi would say that things to come is undoubtedly a very extraordinary film to have been made in britain in one of the few serious british science fiction films to date indeed its set piece design and harnessing of resources are ravenous marvellous yet the script is ultimately over earnest and at times all over the place the direction is prone to a flatness though it does step up a scenic gear or two upon occasion the cinematographer and mr richardson really do salvage things however respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology and an engaging jerky performance that consistently beguiles such a shame there is so little substance or real filmic conception to the whole thing powell and pressburger would have been the perfect directors to take on such a task as this they are without peer among british directors as daring visual storytellers great helmsmen of characters and dealers in dialogue of the first ratethings to come as it stands is an intriguing oddity well worth perusing yet far short of a metropolis tis much as silly in wells words as that lang film yet with nothing like the astonishing force of it,positive

it seems on the surface to be a romantic planes trains and automobiles but at times tried for something more where it failed miserably some may like the nontraditional ending but the attempts at deep insight into the world of marriage flopped around not really going anywherebut if you were interested by the story the movie tried other methods to distract you the unnecessary special effects of which the falling rain was the most obvious served to do nothing but annoy the camera work is erratic at bestone note of caution however my movie experience as a whole was less than satisfying sitting in the first row with a group of younguns around,negative

cant grade this very well because i cant say i liked it but it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film the acting directing atmosphere music were all good its just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you cant truly relate to the movie ends it is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings dont need to make any sense at all and still be strong but thats about itthe plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet dylan thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex girlfriend he is married brings his wife and later the kid while the ex knightley marries some other guy but the tension is there dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of ptsd add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands fullbottom line you have to be in the mood to like this film the hard part is defining this mood i dont think ive ever been in it yet ever so it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about dylan thomas,positive

hey remember when hal hartley was brilliant what a time that was id say the book of life was when things really started going downhill but i will say that at least he went uphill from this one a movie that looks like it was filmed on someones cell phone wouldnt have to be a bad thing if it was distinguished by an interesting story and dialog but alas those are missing along with hartleys spare quirky dialog in their place is tedious exposition on themes of christian end of times and a trite story of a modern jesus in a quandary packaged in a trying to be hip modern world where everyone looks like someone out of a hal hartley movie while it picks up a little in its second half its never enjoyable or especially sensible what the hell happened to you hartley,negative
flavia la monaca muslmana aka flavia the heretic of is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of italian exploitation cinema that to a certain extent follows a somewhat feminist premise though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists set mostly in a convent and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist great performance by the wonderful florinda bolkan flavia the heretic may be referred to as a nunsploitation film however this film differs quite drastically from the typical nunsploitation flicks from the time as it doesnt so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism sadistic lesbian punishments etc personally i saw more similarities to the hexploitation flicks of the time such as mark of the devil even though this one doesnt treat the topic of witch hunts which focus on the brutal execution of christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern perioditaly around after witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded muslim soldier young flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent when her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later falvias disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church and she joins a band of arabic scavengersone thing is for sure flavia the heretic is not for the faint hearted and neither is it for those who want happy endings director gianfranco mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible especially in its nasty scenes the many torture and execution scenes are extremely disturbing with skinnings spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film the violence here is never superfluous however after all this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in the film is very well made with realistic costumes fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by nicola piovani the stunningly beautiful and great florinda bolkan has proved her talent in many great italian cult productions including lucio fulcis giallo masterpiece non si sevizia un paperino of she delivers another great charismatic performance here and i couldnt imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does the film has some minor inconsistencies eg why does the rigid church let bizarre cult followers into convents in the first place however it is overall amazing how realistic this film is flavia the heretic should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of italian exploitation cinema this is a great exploitation flick overall though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema,positive

an old vaudeville team of willy clark walter matthau and al lewis george burns were one of the best known but they broke up hating each other over years later they agree to get together for a tv specialbut find out they still hate each other willys nephew agent richard benjamin tries to get them to work togethera big hit in its day and it won george burns an oscar for best supporting actor i somewhat liked it it was written by neil simon so its non stop one liners some of it was funny but making jokes of willy and als senility was not also i never liked matthau i never thought he was a good actor and something about him just rubbed me the wrong way also his character here is so caustic you get sick of him quickly all that aside this was fun burns is just great tossing off one liners with ease and even matthau was good matching him their verbal battles are the best sequences in the movie also benjamin is very good as willys nephew trying to get the two of them to work with each other for me its worth seeing for burns alone this jump started his career in a big way and two years later he had another hit with oh god so this is good just good not great matthaus character really makes this hard to love i give it a,positive
i noticed at once that this movie really wasnt based on dodie smiths novel in any case it was a nice idea that pongo and perditas son now had his own puppies the cutest of the dalmatians was of course little snowball who was completely spotless till the very end of the film to be honest i didnt know what to think when cruella de vil seemed to have changed completely kind in fact i have often thought about the possibility that she could become friendly but now that she so quickly changed into herself again and announced that she was cruella once more i almost began to be really worried about chloes dalmatiansactually the scene in which the puppies watched lady and the tramp while chloe and kevin had their dinner was much better than i had expected i also was fond of the parrot who played to be a dog and it was incredible that the dogs had learned so many tricks for this movie of course i was content that at the end the dalmatians were saved again but i would have liked to know what was going to happen to cruella after she had lost her whole property and what on earth could the dogs home do with such a huge sum of moneyfinally it was quite touching that snowball also had spots at the very end of the film,positive
this movie is probably the worst i have seen bad acting bad script bad everything comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting both cyborg van damme and nemesis olivier gruner are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still its albert pyun who has directed these two as wellthe story is not original the world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances a special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and theres the story the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them one girl together with a robot kris kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankindin this movie the director tries some hong kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far the movie fails miserably in this attempti recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to and to fans of the genre i recommend cyborg since i think its a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor and if you cant stand van damme then check out nemesisi rated this movie,negative
the dvd was a joke the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and segals voice not even his pathetic when the audio sync was better in about minutes the poor plot lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should bewhile segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made itif segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show because he has no talent what so ever in thisthis film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it i turned it off in about minutesi will be asking for my money back at block buster mark from ontario canada,negative
the consequences of love there is really something special about this film but its very hard to put your finger on it is a love story of sorts but not really one ive seen before it has several love themes running throughout the film one mans love for a younger woman a younger mans love for his older brother the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end the cast are all superb from sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight faced ness of titta the films central character with simple yet affective camera work bounced off an ever changing soundtrack that mixes low fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces the style of the film changes beautifully using several styles without ever getting cluttered love has never looked so diverse and powerful as the tales we are told rumble towards various conclusions the director has married old and new into a rich italian classic,positive
the group of people are travelling to belgrade in an awful bus led by a drunk conductor and his dumb son who likes to drive with his eyes closed their journey is frequently interrupted by many hilarious events which with much irony describe the fall of nations spirit in and are so funny that they are even today used as a common jokes the man who steals the show is a peasant feet tall with his sons who are almost two times bigger than him in the end the movie takes one dramatical turn and the trip becomes nothing but a swans song of a dying country,positive
hideously bad movie purportedly about a croupier who wants to be a writer and the incidents that make up casino life moves at a snails pace dull dull dull virtually everything about this movie is amateurish and unconvincing with one very notable exception the performance of clive owen who is like a rolls royce purring through a slum advice for the casino sequences were allegedly provided by a professional but judging by the way in which they are handled they were completely ignored by the director while casino staff may very well be a different breed to the rest of the world they are nowhere near as witless and booooring as the characters presented in this script odds and ends are thrown into the script in an attempt to provide it with convincing background but would appear to have been jotted down in a list on a cocktail napkin for anyone who makes a living in the casino business as this writer has for the last forty years this is a poverty stricken depiction of their world which even in the farthest and most obscure reaches of england has never been this wanting an appalling insulting mess of a movie that plods and plods and plods along to an idiotic and unconvincing ending american critics loved it,negative
joe was first released in the us in the summer of despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an oscar nom it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the s before being enthusiastically reappraised somewhat unjustly in the us in the late s thanks to this lengthy unavailability its reputation has gone on to see it placed inexplicably alongside the likes of michael winners original death wish although revenge is a theme a film about vigilantism this most definitely is notthe plot isnt worth synopsizing its a flabby hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it that relationship and the largely class based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to realityalmost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated which makes the whole thing completely fascinating hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly its very much a film of the s rather than the s so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the hollywood new wave is a complete mystery martin scorcese of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the dank lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced taxi driver four years later but joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of easy rider and bonnie and clyde rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethosit isnt a film of any real artistic significance despite joes incontinent fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented shot on and around the streets of new york city during the darkest hours of the vietnam war and at a time when america and significantly its cinema was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture itbut as a film despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a michael winner film but not as well made how does that tickle your fancy incidentally if you are like me a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes then check out harold steptoe at in the hippy art gallery,negative

this is a wonderful movieits funny dark poignant thought provoking innocently naughty and generally entertaining all around i dont know that ive seen the like beforethe raptureor maybe one of todd solondzs black as night comedies or even the recent movie teeth come to mindbut those are all bitter nasty little gems franklins despite the darkness around the edges manages to have a thoroughly sincere and pure heartthe story is similar to john waters low down dirty shame only this film differs in that it actually has a story and something to say as well beyond waters juvenile sex isnt dirty snicker nudge nudge message a conservative repressed family undergoes a drastic change as a result of a car accident and suddenly arent so conservative anymorein fact theyre finally actually happy probably the only people in their town or maybe the entire world who are to talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the film simply put everyone should see it though of course only people who are already sold on what the movies upbeat hopeful philosophy is ever wouldthe acting is great just this side of realistic enough to keep the proceedings from getting too heavyteresa willis gives an especially memorable and brave performance as an uptight mother who emerges like a butterfly when shes freed up both she and robertson dean deserve kudos for their unflinchingly sincere performances not to mention frequent and extensive nudity and sex scenes they turn what could have been a salacious joke involving a deviant sex practice into a touching believable and endearing moment aviva as the daughter is a standout and someone to watch perfectly capturing the attitude angst and speech patterns of a girl her age vince pavia as the himbo brother with a secret is good looking and functional although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his actual acting mari blackwell as the conflicted best friend to mother franklin is wonderfully cold confused and even compassionate in a role that could have gone over the toptechnically the film looks fantastic all bright colors and wide open localesit looks like it may have been shot hi defif so the line has gotten very thin it looks very much like film there is a great deal of talking and a lot of it philosophical which gets a bit preachy moreso id imagine to a viewer who disagrees with the films politics but this film says a lot of things that need sayingif only people wouldnt be afraid to listen and think the arguments that take place are smart and well thought out first and foremost refusing to demonize either the religious or non religious partiesthe ending is on the ambiguous side which i found a bit of a disappointment somehowi think it wouldve worked better had the author as jay floyd is since he produced wrote and directed given a more workable denouement some sort of solution but then again there probably isnt one when it comes to pitting people with different faiths against one another all the same it was a moving memorable final image that left me choked up a success meanwhile im awfully glad mr floyd got this film made and look forward to sharing it with as many people as possible check it out,positive
an extra is called upon to play a general in a movie about the russian revolution however he is not any ordinary extra he is serguis alexander former commanding general of the russia armies who is now being forced to relive the same scene which he suffered professional and personal tragedy in to satisfy the director who was once a revolutionist in russia and was humiliated by alexander it can now be the time for this broken man to finally win his penultimate battle this is one powerful movie with meticulous direction by von sternberg providing the greatest irony in alexanders character in every way he can jannings deserved his oscar for the role with a very moving performance playing the general at his peak and at his deepest valley powell lends a sinister support as the revenge minded director and brent is perfect in her role with her face and movements showing so much expression as jannings love all around brilliance rating,positive
this was a wonderful little american propaganda film that is both highly creative and openly discusses the nazi atrocities before the entire extent of the death camps were revealed while late and into would reveal just how evil and horrific they were this film unlike other hollywood films to date is the most brutally honest film of the era i have seen regarding nazi atrocitiesthe film begins in a courtroom in the future after the war is over the film was made in the war ended in may in this fictitious world court a nazi leader is being tried for war crimes wilhelm grimm is totally unrepentant and one by one witnesses are called who reveal grimms life since in a series of flashbacks at first it appears that the film is going to be sympathetic or explain how grimm was pushed to join the nazis however after a while it becomes very apparent that grimm is just a sadistic monster these episodes are amazingly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the film seem less like a piece of propaganda but a legitimate dramaall in all the film does a great job considering the film mostly stars second tier actors there are many compelling scenes and performances especially the very prescient jewish extermination scene towards the end that cant help but bring you close to tears it was also interesting how around the same point in the film there were some super creative scenes that use crosses in a way you might not notice at first overall its a must see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good filmfyi this is not meant as a serious criticism of the film but hitler was referred to as that paper hanger this is a reference to the myth that hitler had once made money putting up wallpaper this is in fact not true previously hed been a starving artist homeless person and served well in the german army in wwi a horrible person yes but never a paper hanger,positive
hr is what himesh is called in the movie i think he likes it too its amazing how intelligent people talented even fall in to the same trapi really like reshamiya its amazing what he has done no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himselfand i truly expected a great film what with the budget of cr and the cute actress as intense as reshamiya is i thought he would excel at a sentimental and an emotional role ironically he is depicted the same but for what care sheer incompetence carelessness awful acting banal background music insensitive direction make it a real painblunders rule ex how can german police issue public instructions on a loud speaker in english they communicate among themselves in english unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too the worse thing is that the majority just doesnt caresongs are the only saving graceplease dont repeat this hr and find yourself a good director low budget no problemthe villain should really have shaved his head instead of the wig you know after all its a cr movie,negative

this film is about a gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead theres a lot of mumbo jumbo about the internet ie if you install a program on the computer you see dead folks much like if you play a videotape youll die in ringu frankly most of this seemed rather silly and lost me what i did find interesting is the idea that the dead live within their own separate existence being totally alone for eternity this was sobering and fascinatingi love japanese films and have seen a huge number compared to most americans however one genre that has become popular in recent years that i just cant relate to very well are these horror films i know they are super popular especially since they seem to be remade so often in the states ive seen both ringu as well as the ring ju on and the grudge and was rather ambivalent despite their popularity about the only recent horror film i really liked from japan was seance a reworking of the great british film seance on a wet afternoon and what do i think made seance different well unlike the other films as well as kairo gobs and gobs of money werent spent on special effects or trying to scare the audience instead the emphasis was on the story the bottom line is that these other films are a lot like american films like halloween or friday th with scary things jumping out just to scare the audience and plot is purely secondary at best for me i want story not cheap thrills or ghosts as the primary focus of the filmwith a relatively high rating i know i am in the minority but i just dont find this a very satisfying film all too often minor things occur that might startle someone slightly but the characters begin screaming and crying and acting as if to say this is the scariest film ever made so youd better start shaking well i think it just tries too hard and i wish it had focused more on the afterlife seen at the end of the film and plot progression not scare tactics,negative
beyond the clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art the overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen the autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience or to put it another way an old man i know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as beyond the clouds nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is the dialogue doesnt really matter too much not that there is much of it anyway and as for storylines forget it some films exist just as visual experiences this is one of them dont bother if you want simple entertainmentthis not for you i could enthuse about the visual perfection of this movie for days but i wont if you are at all interested in cinematography photography film direction etc watch this film,positive
billed as a kind of sequel to the full monty about unemployed men in sheffield this movie is a fakeas someone born in sheffield and still with links to the city i was extremely disappointed by this film someone said it could have been set in oklahoma and that just about sums it up for me this looked like a romantic view of northern england made for the us market probably many americans and many southern english people dont realize that sheffield is a big city of around half a million inhabitants with a sophisticated urban culture in among giants it was depicted as some dreary dead end semi rural small town where everyone in sheffield seemed to drink in the same old fashioned pub and where the peoples idea of a party was line dancing in some village hall lookalike this was a small close knit community not a metropolitan citythe working class sheffield men were totally unlike their real life counterparts who are generally taciturn and communicate with each other in grunts and brief dry remarks they dont chatter and they certainly dont sing in choirseven the rural settings supposedly in the peak district looked alien to me i recognized a few places where i used to go hiking but some of the aerial shots of pylons stretching out over a bleak landscape reminded me more of wales indeed in the credits at the end i spotted a reference to gwynedd wales the peak district is in the summer crawling with walkers and tourists in cars it is situated between two big cities it is not some kind of wildernessas for the notion that a young woman could fall in love with and lust after pete postlethwaite that was ludicrous and could only have been a male dream her reasons for becoming his lover were never made apparent none of the men was shown as having a partner or families they existed in a vacuumanyone wanting to see a film about unemployed sheffielders would have been led astray this sheffield existed only in the minds of its middle class writers and film makersit was a gigantic fake,negative
this movie is similar to the play entitled blithe spirit written by noel coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to cowards writing im surprised that movies of this nature dont acknowledge the original writers concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff but it issad these movies are so expensive to produce i do perk up when a screenplay is original i even perk up when its an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some samples mentioned such as topper etc i realize that movies are still a comparatively affordable form of entertainment however im not please when the publics taste is taken for granted in this situation the publics taste is overlookedi look forward to better produced movie entertainmentin this case i rather see the play,negative

those engaging the movie camera so early in the century must have figured out some of its potential very early on this is a good story of a playboy type who needs money and inadvertently sells his soul to satan for a lot of money unfortunately the soul is his double and he must confront him frequently tearing his life apart there are some wonderful scenes with people fading out and of course the scenes when the two are on the stage at the same time the middle part is a bit dull but the faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer one thing i have to mention is the general unattractiveness of the people in the movie also they pretty much shied away from much action which would have at least given some life to the thing i first was made aware of this movie about years ago and have finally been able to see it i was not disappointed,positive
what this movie is not cool entertainingwhat this movie is visually interesting difficult to get through intentionali feel that this movie puts the viewer if he or she is willing through a clip of time where they experience a world without language much like how animals must experience the world you dont really watch this movie as much as you witness an awful series of events in what feels like real timeconsistently it goes on much longer than is comfortable this movie could be edited down to a minute short and it would be a totally different movie it would be cool and entertaining but the experience would be lost i have seen a lot of cool movies but i have never experienced one like this if you can get your head in the right place for this one you should be able to really appreciate but likely not enjoy what they accomplished here out of,positive
comes this heartwarming tale of hope hope that youll never have to endure anything this awful again cough razzie award coughi disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained when i requested my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing i wasnt entitled to reimbursement i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already thoughthe movie summary is pretty basic the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police underneath this clever outline however lies a repertoire of original fresh and hilarious skits or notask yourself the following do you like to see people getting hit by pans do you like fart jokes do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus do you like tired racial jokes do you think babies say goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa do you droolif you answered yes to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you although it has been billed in some places as the worst movie of the decade there is probably a movie or that are worsesomewhere i cant say for sure i gave this movie stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldnt be taken seriously this lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone save your money for something funnyrespect,negative
contains spoilersluchino viscontis film adaptation of thomas manns novella is visually if not philosophically faithful to its source brittens opera offers a more faithful reading of the apollonian dionysian struggles which consume the aging writer it is certainly one of the most gorgeous films ever made in the visconti version the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story never has venice looked more beautiful and alluring more decadent and effete if youve read the novella its like having the descriptions on its pages come to life dirk bogarde gives an outstanding performance as gustav von aschenbach although he has very little dialogue he conveys the bitterness aroused passion and finally pitiful yearning of aschenbach through facial expressions alone bjorn andresen the young actor who plays tadzio the beautiful object of aschenbachs desire was perfectly cast he too plays the part with facial expressions and gestures the tadzio character is pivotal to the story so any actor in this role must be worthy of inspiring passion and desire visconti with his incredible eye for beauty knew exactly what he was doing and changing ashenbach from a writer to a composer based on gustav mahler and then using mahlers music especially the adagietto from the th symphony was another brilliant stroke although id read the mann story before the film mahlers music and death in venice will always be inextricably linked in my mind as will the haunting images which appear throughout the film especially that last one of ashenbach dying on the beach as tadzio walks slowly into the sea one day this film will be released in dvd widescreen format and its visual splendors completely restored to us,positive
this film is one of the best shorts ive ever seen and as i make it a point to be at all the major film festivals ive seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best im not a fan of monaghan his acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in lost so i generally try to avoid his films i did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed this director really knows what shes doing of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who dont understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it but luckily from what ive seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gemlets not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because thats certainly true the production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school pretend for a moment that the budget doesnt matter if you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasnt the fault of the filmmaker i saw this at a festival and the sound was finei guarantee whoever made the dvd itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on mini dv then what are you left with the story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawlessnanavati can tell a story that much is clear she can write substance heavy engaging scripts better than most people in hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards give it more experienced actors better sound post production and mm instead of mini dv and even the trolls couldnt complain this girl is incredible and keeping in mind that insomniac was made a good few years ago shes done some amazing work since the trailer for dreams of an angel shows that and i cant wait to see the higher budget stuff shes done stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker,positive
i saw this film for one reason the tagline is upset the head and youre dead cracking its not surprising that this silly horror comedy runs out of steam before the tape is out of the box but it wrings a few laughs from its oddball premise and cast of characters an eagle eyed human radar a huge strongman and a big breasted sexual magnet are all mind controlled by a huge head in a chair whos not happy about his family being blackmailed by a murderous scumbag this looks like being a promising mixture of ham and cheese before it becomes clear that the characters are one joke wonders and the plot is pretty ordinary if you erm ignore the giant head,negative
okay its a movie for children and its not one of those movies that adults will enjoy as well however there are some unintentionally funny moments most of them involving holes in the story for example the kid needs a computer part to bring his dad back to normal and he doesnt have the money so does he ask his father for the dough nope he steals it and gets caught kids if im ever turned invisible ill advance your allowance ok also while this kid is at the police station no doubt about to be charged with criminally lame acting his beautiful blond teacher comes in announces who she is and where she works then busts the child out of the slam in front of the cops to make matters worse instead of making a quick getaway they then sit in the parking lot of the police station and laugh about their achievement you know i hate to pick but the kid did steal something and ought to face the consequences but maybe being in this movie is punishment enough yall avoid it,negative
the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened or to sell in home movie format more than a generation after they were first released superchick which was first released in now comes into this category its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist filmdespite the superwoman connotation superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the s was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port since she holds black belt status in karate she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candysuperchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a years time despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than,negative

this is the best movie ive ever seen and ive seen a lot im not even a troma fan ive never heard of troma before watching this moviei had already given up hope to see a great movie until i saw tromeo and juliet this movie is a dream coming true shakespeare would likely be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic there are sex violence humor and satire it breaks many taboosthis movie is neither disgusting nor stupid its hard to describe with words how clever funny exciting and witty this movie is the music is great and perfectly fits every scene the characters are very believable and the acting is great i really cared for the charactersit is certainly not for tromas fans only its for all people who have a sense of humor and like clever and believable entertainment as opposed to totally stupid and unbelievable mainstream movies that dont dare to do what this movie doesthe bad reviews only prove that this movie is great and something exceptional you either love it or hate it like all true works of art it isnt understood and appreciated by all people,positive

cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that ive ever seennot that they didnt try there was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting im not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrongsome of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing i had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran there was also an insincerity about it all being that i went with someone who used to be a heroin addict he was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it that was bolstered by the pretty year old girl who was in love with the year old junkieand the frantic nature of the lead was a turn off enough there were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure but the end result was listless and unending with uneven time lines the characters were colorful but to no end which made me feel bad for the quality actors who youve just not seen enoughskip it i assumed that this was a first time director who was enamored by his own turds but he has done this before im puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money,negative
lets set one thing straight this movie does not seek to redefine the genre its not dr strangelove o young frankenstein its a silly flick with three great female leads cant remember any other comedy with similar characteristics rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey charming as ever the story is basic the three gals were losers in college and are still after wards it poehler is a dog trainer who cant even get a date with a blind guy posey is an assistant for a senator who hasnt been touched by a man since clinton was in office i catched that one several minutes later im a little slow ok and dracht has a gay fiancée seth meyers from snl funny they have to prevent the uncool daughter of the senator the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series joan of arcadia to embarrass her during spring break so of course they have to go to watch over her and some hilarity ensues all in all a light simple comedy quite short and quite enjoyable,positive
i guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first superman filmas it is just as crummy and painfully long as the originalafter an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals the credits pay homage to the even crummy looking for their time futuristic sweeping credits of the original superman filmthen there is some more murky stuff ma kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield then superman sneaks up on her and faintsnext we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close ups of an old lady as she dies we dont see luthors face until the end of the scene an early instance of the films drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned lex luthor is a guy who doesnt like superman because he is not human also he probably doesnt like humans either as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about lex luthor planning to kill most of earths populationafter a while clark kent shows up back at his old job i forgot to mention he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened then he finds out lois lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating cyclops it upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frameat this point we see that miss lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle it is some kind of important event on account of it is on television then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event there are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit the film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summeras the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build i excused myself to get a soda i accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about al gore showing slides in its entirety i tried to find my way back to superman returns but i somehow wandered into prairie home companion which i watched twice in a row then it was time to stop messing aroundi walked back into the first theater found my seat and looked up to see that the impending lois lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us still it seemed to be taking forever so i wandered around the theater met a girl got married raised a son and sent him off to college while attending my sons medical school graduation i remembered that i should probably check in on superman returns so i excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane when they did superman saved everybody which was pretty cool and then there is a a subplot where superman turns really creepy and starts stalking lois lane and her family with his x ray vision and super hearing then he tries to get her to cheat on cyclops who seems like a good guymeanwhile lex luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie i forgot to bring my scorecard home with me they give you one at the door but i think he scored damn close to one hundred percent i hope he wins the million dollarsat this point things start to gear up for the big murky finale i think maybe the projector was broken on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here i remember seeing murky things growing out of the water superman getting sick superman getting better back to the murky things hes sick again no wait hes okay againthen lex luthor unleashed his final bad guy move yelling at his girlfriend a little bitthen superman died and came back to life i thought the movie was over so i leftninety years later the nursing home where i lived felt a little chilly i realized i left my sweatshirt back in the theater and i went to retrieve it when i did i was slightly surprised to find that superman returns wasnt over yet i tried to ask some of the viewers what i missed but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by nowi sat back in my old seat and watched as lois lane puttered around her house for a while then superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie and since i already saw that part i thought it was okay to leaveso that is my review of superman returnsoh also if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog you will love this movie on account of there are two jokes like that in it,negative
this film is one of my favorite christmas classics sure its fluff its not relevant but when did movies being simply entertaining and fun become a bad thing no this movie is definitely a good thing as martha stewartappropriatelywould say barbara stanwyck is so appealing in this film and dennis morgan perfectly compliments her both of them have charm and warmth to spare they are assisted by a crew of those incredible character actors who seem to have disappeared since the s and s sydney greenstreet szcuddlessakall reginald gardiner and una oconnor among them where are characters like this today not one role could have been better cast bette davis thankfully refused this role as beneath her and she was right to refuse it she would have attempted to steam roll over everyone and everything around her and completely destroyed the film stanwyck was a strong actress but had the wisdom to play this lightly she has seldom been more appealing and is pitch perfect morgan is the essence of the nice guy because his part is the least splashy there is a tendency to overlook his skill just the fact that he could hold his own surrounded by such distinct character actors is an accomplishment in itself but he too is absolutely perfect as jefferson jones skip the ill advisedand pointless remake and watch this bright sparkling holiday gift,positive
this movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in minutes except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book a book full of strong latino characters and they are represent for the most part by non latinos there is no character development in the movie and we have no reason to love or hate the characters and to delete a complete generation is inexcusable isabel allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read,negative
i got this movie from ebay mainly because im gay and i love til schweiger however its one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself hmm i forgot about this boring part ill go make popcorn it doesnt have that part its a very fluid and constantly interesting film and yes til schweiger is worth it if nothing else but its a great movie even for straight guys,positive
will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldnt get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers its an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful,negative
ill keep this short as a movie like this doesnt deserve a full reviewgiven the setting this movie could have been something really special it could have been another days later or even a blair witch projectthe first or so minutes of the movie i was really excited directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense although i dont think he managed to capture true eeriness of an empty london undergroundcharacters were a big let down our heroine in this movie is a worthless piece of crap and you really dont care if she dies or not as many people have said before i was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy who managed to give me a chuckle or twowhether intentional of the writers or notthe main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie but when he is revealed i was really disappointed i wont spoil it but lets just say my year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling matchall in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple hollywood formula this film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the markjust to highlight how lame this movie was the characters in this movie had at least five times to finish off and kill the main villain instead they run away,negative
the best screen performance ever by george c scott the screenplay by chayefsky the irony freighted dialogue is near perfect just where do you train your nurses dachau rigg is wonderful as the rescuing angel who saves scott from doom as is the whole cast its a hilarious and serious movie it is a movie of the period the s but it is not in any sense dated what it is about the chaos and irrationality of the system vs the sanity of the individual is timeless and the we heal nothing we cure nothing monologue delivered shouted actually as no one else but scott could with its references to cloning and other wonders of modern science could literally have been written this morning,positive
having recently seen grindhouse i was browsing in video usa looking for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theatres in downtown areas during the s the hong kong action flick five fingers of death seemed just such a picture the cartoon like sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while i was so involved in the story and the characters i didnt care parts of the music score sounded like the ironside tv theme song that was subsequently used in quentin tarantinos kill bill movies some scenes involving the heros fiancé seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didnt ruin the film the most exciting parts involve the tournament and some revenge segments after that well worth seeing for kung fu fans,positive
there is no director i like more than mamoru oshii but sadly even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks tachiguishi is one of them and even though i loved it to bits its not hard to see why distributors in the west are somewhat reluctant to release itin between his big and serious films oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects while tachiguishi definitely falls into this category oshii has really outdone himself with this one creating something that is very hard to classify even as a freaky japanese flick go figureat its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike otaku no video but rather than make a fool of an existing subculture oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes scrounging away food for free and upholding the japanese culinary level oshiis approach on the subject has close ties with dai nipponjin as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be deadpan humor taken to the extremebut that is not all rather than simply shooting his mockumentary oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation a weird mix of live action photography digital animation and puppets on a stick performed and acted out or posed if you want by the greats of the japanese animation industry no less as the project was supposed to be as low budget as possibleand if you think that just about covers it know that the film is extremely dialogue heavy making it a good companion piece for innocence the influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural political and even philosophical angles fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues and to make it even worse the whole film is completely grounded in actual japanese history and customs making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material needless to say multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the filmthat said on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post war japan the film plays like youd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold but somehow the big and crudely animated cut out photography limbs of which figures are assembled dont quite make it all that serious the range of characters introduced is sublime shinji higuchi taking the cake as cow creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast food chains with his gang of bull peopleoshii regular kenji kawai provides besides a pretty comical performance a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky strange and comical a lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the filmvisually the film is very atmospheric though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective remains toned down only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time which is not exactly a bad thing seeing how tachiguishi is so dialogue heavy despite that the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the filmbeware though because tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer if you dont speak japanese there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention on top of that the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow the film still lacks english subtitles and even though my french was largely sufficient to get what it was all about im sure i missed many of the finer points of the filmtachiguishi is not an easy film to get into but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesnt let off from there on i still hope to see this one again with english or dutch subs a dub would actually be best for a film like this much like container though i guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask forwith all of that said i can only congratulate oshii on another marvelous film its rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works the film is smart looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity it is immensely funny even if you cant catch all the details on the first viewing but be sure to at least get this with decent subs as the automated english translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at alltachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and im not surprised the french got their release while the rest of europe and the rest of the western world is still waiting for a sign of this film but for those that like oshii appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits it is a film that cannot be missed even though it could just as well misfire,positive
so terrific so good i have never seen a man be more funny than eddie murphy in this stand up comedy you will see a lot of imitations more done by anyoneif you have seen raw you will have to see delirious its so funny its so professional,positive
this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in humanizing the figures of sam houston bowie travis and crockettthe focus here is on jim bowie played with sharp cynical detachment by james arness who is apparently still alive at age then he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this partpuerto rican born raul julia humanizes gen santa ana as no one since j carol naish back in had done however the mexican dictator is portrayed as a lecherous vainglorious popinjay gaudier uniforms have never been seen before or since he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but convinced of his own infallibility he does not heed italec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays col william travis his portrayal is earnest he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with himthe one jarring note was brian keith as crockett in a coonskin cap and carrying ol betsy he stumbles about as if he had wandered in from another movie with no conviction in the portrayal the character is reduced to a few stage conventions the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or suppressed in earlier film versions we learn that jim bowie was in the person of santa ana fighting his own brother in law the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with rifles left over from the napoleonic wars a generation earlier santa ana likes a bargain bowie wryly explains the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a fort was militarily ill advised a fact explored in greater depth in the film the alamo,positive
this is definatley one of the best stand up shows evre ever eddie is so off the wall that ive been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks its a masterpeice you need look no further than this line the word herb you say erb and we say herb cuz thers a fing h in it brilliant,positive
this movie was yet another waste of time why oh why do i keep renting crap like this someone please tell me sigh oh well back to the movie at hand cube zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie like i did and just want to check out whats up in the last hopefully movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and screenwriters employed then of course this is the movie for you but if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a fantastic plot evil grin then this movie is definitely for you d ok im lying at best this movie sucks ok i have to admit that certain elements to it was cool well coolish and i laughed quite a few times prolly at the wrong things but nevertheless i was amused but all in all the few things that barely makes the ok category isnt enough to make this movie worth it at all unless you count manos hand of fate one of the top ten movies ever,negative
two hands is an entertaining funny story about australian lowlifes the screenplay contrasts the world of fast money and deadly acts with the inexplicability of fate and circumstance in a subtle way we are asked to ponder the concept that major events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the root causes the forces of fate and circumstance take jimmy the main character into situations that bring about the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more personally promising worldthe clueless jimmy portrayed with acumen by heath ledger is a kid who grew up without opportunity the high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to his blunted senses the love and help of friends guides him to a higher plateauthe film is well directed and well acted the band of criminals teeter between likable and despicable keeping us interested in their crazy antics all through the film,positive
this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seen the footage is extraordinary mesmerizing at times it also received an oscar for best photography and deservedly so i have many movies in my film collection and several more ive seen besides them and not many of them are more beautifully or even equally as beautifully shot as this oneits unique and an overall great movie the cast is terrific and do a great job in portraying their characters we follow their destinies with devotion and get very emotionally attached to them along the way we also learn things about ourselves and our lives i think much of this film for what it represent and how it present it i warmly recommend it,positive
this movie quite literally does not have one redeeming feature the characters are one dimensional cliched incredibly misogynistic and stupid the script looks as if it was cobbled together from other movies the acting is horrible and some of the gross out humour made me feel nauseousshame on you gregory poirier for thinking any of this would be funny or interestingthe worst movie ive seen in several years,negative
i dont watch a lot of tv except for the office weeds entourage and es soup i think i hold this show in good companyi love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a sanjaya or heidi montag spthe best part is that soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments cmon most people get hooked into watching american idol because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch and that means i dont have to suffer through the other of these mind numbing talk shows or reality shows for one nugget of funny or shock the only reason why soup doesnt get a in my opinion are sometime the sketches are not that funny and on an even rarer occasion the commentary isnt always up to par but they cant all be home runs either if so soup wouldnt be on ejoels quick wit and soups writing team which includes mchale make for a great show i happen to enjoy the laughing and comments from the crew who are off camera even when theyre being blatantly obvious by giving occasional courtesy laughs its hilarious because it is forced theyre obviously being ironic and thats part of what makes this show funny,positive
barney and friendsthe dora the explorer of the sok ill admit it as a kid barney was my ultimate hero i had my barney plush toy and i used to watch the same barney episodes over and over on videotape maybe cause it was so sugar coated and mind numbinghowever by the time i turned i started to hate barney everyone at school would dis barney and i went along with it mainly because it was funny and its what little boys do but a few years later i discovered something else about barney that i will never forgeta person known on the imdb as angelmeiru did an essay for school explaining the dangers of watching barney and he or she posted it in the message boards a lot of those dangers made sensebarney is a dinosaur who can magically come to life during a day at school he is supposedly educational or so sheryl leach barneys creator says but really all i can remember him teaching me is that magic can solve anything which is not trueto end off this comment id like to tell you a little story there was once a young boy who watched a particular episode of barney one day he was alone when a stranger lured him into his car and drove away with him i dont know the outcome but its safe to assume the child died but why was he abducted in the first place because he watched the barney and friends episode titled a stranger is a friend you havent met yet,negative

yes in this movie you are treated to multiple little snowmen on the attack in apparently a very warm climate so yes this movie is definitely not to be taken seriously it is in fact a much worse movie than the original as at least with that one the whole production looked like it cost more than a couple of bucks and a video camera to make it has its funny moments but really playing off the cheapness of your movie and making that be your intended laughs is kind of weak film making if you ask me you can not come up with a good story your effects are going to really be bad hey let us just make the movie look as bad as possible with horrible one liners and we have our movie the first one at least had a somewhat credible story as the snowman in that one attacked during the winter and not what amounts to a resort it also had better effects too this one is just a step or two ahead of hobgoblins as far as the monsters are concerned and you really want to be more than a step a two above a bunch of hand puppets still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost actually i am just kidding but really it was the funniest part of the movie,negative
yet another version of mother of all gangster flicks the classic godfather and yet another case of over hype due to media circus sarkar the th hindi film of ram gopal varma as director is also the weakest in his underworld trilogy including the other two being the excellent satya and company the charisma the magnetic persona of the two bachchans playing father son duo on screen for the first time is definitely a treat to watch out for not just strong performances but their perfect chemistry is the biggest scoring point here for which varma should be applauded however the same equation of the duo is missing with the other characters in the film reason the other characters look more like cardboard caricatures esp the villains represent the typical bollywood baddies a character who attracts attention is elder son played by kaykay but again not able to hold due to half baked characterization the drama and conflict is brought alive by the excessive use of close shots which brought a claustrophobic effect rightly needed to construct an ambiance the haunting score amar mohile and the sound design kunal mehta parikshit lalwani anup dev together with dark murky background overlapped by shinning powerful images camerawork by amit roy contributes to visuals so typical of ramus style but there is an overuse of music though fortunately no songs are there in the film but can interest of todays intelligently growing audience be sustained just on shoulders of two performers and strong visuals i dont think so surely audience maangey more and here film fails to deliver in any adaptation in order to add a new dimension the biggest pre requisite is the screenplay which is sluggish here not being crisp at places and therefore the pace slackens quite often what finally audience is subjected to is a highly predictable very commonplace drama with very little surprise elements top stunt director allan amin ghani is also not in his best form some scenes which require a different treatment includes a minister is talking foul about sarkar and the son is overhearing a very amateurish shoot out in the jail on sarkar sarkar jr escapes from the clutches of his enemies a son easily motivated to kill his own father a son is secretly entering his fathers room to kill him a police commissioner slapping sarkar jr all this requires a more realistic hard hitting approach which is the back bone to create the required conflict the dialogues are weak for eg look at an amateurish line where a cm says to sarkar jr wo jo police commissioner tha na usay maine hata diya the women folk take on sarkars working is completely ignored the uninterrupted negotiations about criminal activities while sarkar is with his family also look slightly out of place in fact the film follows a graph quite similar to ramus own production ab tak chhappan in depicting the battle between good and evil the other side of life the law police administration politics is completely ignored certainly more is expected in content here the film definitely falls short and could not rise above an average fare dear ramu agreed that now you are laughing your way to the bank you definitely need to take some drastic overhauling measures in your film production factory before it is too late,negative
first of allwhat the hell why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldnt watch what the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked offa guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth but from what i hear its not even offensivesothey promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbageand they cant even pull that off,negative
ugh pretty awfullinnea quigley gets top billing but her character doesnt have a big part who is her character supposed to be anyway the little boys aunt another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene while there was a shower scene in the movie it was a head and shoulders shot perhaps there are some alternate versions of this moviequigley does have a bigger part than john carradine cameron mitchell and brinke stevens though carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog no other characters are in the scene with him though hes sort of composited in or else there are over the shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else theres also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket it looks like a bad photocopy and a decent picture of him in a family bible he conjured up jack o originally or something like thatcameron mitchell briefly shows up on a tv as a tv horror host brinke stevens is in the movie hes showing the coven in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe evidently theres more of the brinke footage as a bonus feature on the retromedia dvd double feature mark of the witch the brides wore bloodjack o whats it about darn if i know a little boy is told a story about a pumpkin headed demon killer and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason she follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for halloween put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes etc the pumpkin headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things and actually kills peoplethere are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too ancestors of his i think i think they figure into jack os backstory but im not sure howthe little boy is ostensibly the main character but we dont really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses has nightmares and will fight bullies even if hell get beat up in the process more time should have been spent establishing his character i couldnt have cared less if he diednot recommended not even for halloween,negative
when one of my friends recommended this to me raving about how well it was filmed the underlying themes and the general greatness of the film i obviously expected an amazing at least entertaining filmthe two hours i spent watching this turned out to be a huge disappointing waste of my timei understand that this movie is meant to be surreal but even in surreal movies there is something which anchors it down even if it is only in the slightest this movie on the other hand felt forced and fake a lot of the shots were unnecessary and watching it made me think the director was trying to hard to be artisticthe acting was poor and the relationships between characters were not nearly developed enough maybe thats just me missing something that others could see but i hadnt even realised there was any sort of attraction between dae su and migo before they started getting at it like rabbits randomly half way through the film then again maybe this film was just badi am not against violence in movies but in this one almost all of it was just unnecessary throughout all the fight scenes i felt myself cringing at how painfully cliché it all wasand the plot the word laughable comes to mind i would be amused if i hadnt wasted two hours of my life following this poorly thought out and ridiculous plot despite all the movies flaws by the end of it i was expecting something interesting to conclude it i wont discuss the ending because i wouldnt want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it just that the metaphor be it a rock or a grain of sand in water they sink as the same cannot be used as an explanation for everythingthis entire movie was made for shock value and shock value only i just hope sooner or later people will stop being so pretentious and recognise a bad movie for what it is ive seen many other great korean films and it depresses me that people have hailed oldboy as the best,negative
really dont care that no one on here likes this movie i do and thats what this review is about lou diamond phillips is great in this comedic role that line about train a b and c is now to me an instant classic the cg is great yeah train looks a little fake but the aliens wow do they ever rock todd bridges wheres arnold and mr drummond wow hes been out of the loop guess thats what jail does to you a bullet train is on its way to las vegas with the senator for him to deliver a big speech a meteor has just hit and now all of a sudden we got aliens running loose aboard the train and our hero cop has to save the day to make matters worse his ex wife is on board arguing with him i just thought this movie was so wonderful a must see if you like action,positive
the revisionist history making the evil marquis de sade a semi heroic romantic is mind boggling enough but the atrocious acting amateurish cinematography and terrible dubbing make this film achingly bad the only reason to keep watching is that almost all the women in the film are gorgeous and amazingly being tortured for days with hands bound overhead apparently doesnt detract from a womans beauty hairstyle and makeup my guess is that the producers filmed mostly in russia choosing women for their looks and willingness to work cheap rather than acting ability if you decide to watch this because you have nothing better to do or are a film student looking for bad examples fast forward through every scene not involving nudity,negative
this movie is based on a play and is the second adaptation of this work paul sorvino plays the basketball coach of a team of players that against all odds took home the championship years ago they have all met for a reunion terry kinney plays james a junior high principal and will quickly get on your nerves with all his whining and feel sorry for me role vincent donofrio as phil plays an obnoxious businessman with just the right amount of money cockiness tony shalhoub is george the current mayor of the town and appears to be on the verge of some sort of breakdown gary sinise plays tom a writer turned alcoholic and in my opinion is excellent in the role while they are all suppose to be celebrating their championship conflicts jealousy and fighting abound as the men come to terms with what was and is now they are forced to look at their lives in a non pleasant way its unusual to have a group of men talking and crying about what could have been and i found it interesting watching them relate to each other its not the best movie ive seen but its certainly good enough for a viewing,positive
jamie foxx is fun but this movie has been done before the bad guy plays a malkovichian character from in the line of fire the cops will do anything to find the bad guy and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf,negative
great artists always suffered while they were young i could mention mozart and beethoven but that is not the point this movie was made by h g clouzot whose family wanted him to succeed in the law professionsits main star is louis jouvet who studied and practiced as as pharmacist before becoming the greatest actor and also director of frances theater before and after wwiithey both had health problems clouzot had tb while young jouvet had cardiac problems and died on a theatersuch events shape the character of men and women of course one might even say that todays artists are so poor because they had never suffered and fought for their livesto me this is the greatest of clouzots movies wages of fear is greater in suspense diabolique also has more suspense and a better plot and is more about female evilquai des orfvres is more human clouzot was falsely accused by de gaulles entourage mostly communists and jews of collaboration with the nazis and banned from making films until until de gaulle left frances government in early de gaulle came back in as presidentthe main characters are all good souls jenny lamour may perform as a putain on stage but she is not a whore dictionaires make synonyms of those words but they are not the same loves her husband and refuses the slight advances from her presumably lesbian friend dora the photographermaurice the husband is jealous and timid but runs away from the scene of the crime he is a coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an eventually more upscale career for loveantoine the detective interpreted by the great louis jouvet basically a stage actor performs in this french gray not noir as well as eg robinson in double indemnity shows flair for pseudo criminals tenderness for a negro son and compassion for the true author of the crime because he remembers that is father cleaned the latrines at some noblemans chteauclouzot was capable of slapping an actors face in order to put him in the right frame of mind but deep inside he was very human i have his horoscope in front of me he had venus in sagittarius which means open heartedness devotion charity and altruism for those who do not believe in astrology my most sincere apologies,positive
this movie is about development people growing and people fading people surprising and people disappointing it has it all and more there is hope frustration injustice justice love and hate it is truly a classic drama that has fantastic performances from the whole cast but especially whoopi goldberg in her debut rolethis movie made me feel very human and proud of it and i suggest that this movie should be mandatory each saturday in all prisons in the world it touches your compassion rating of ps i admit it i shed a tear of joy during the final scene,positive
the final part of kieslowskis trilogy based on the colors of the french flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image in red imagery is paramount as well as the obvious but clever color coding however rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the cinema du look kieslowskis red is a multi layered densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love in red love and fate are intertwined but complex notions dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by you sense red is really an allegory a reenactment of prosperos omnipresent gestures in the tempest yet it is more than its story appears red demands countless viewings and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structurealthough red stands alone as a masterwork from kieslowski its best viewed as part of the trilogy elements of blue and white are referenced in red which knowing viewers will enjoy,positive
as a longtime admirer of the film moulin rouge and a more recent admirer of jean renoirs film making i knew that id inevitably watch his french cancan sooner or later the movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the moulin rouge nightclub the impresario danglard jean gabin tries to turn montmartre laundress nini franoise arnoul into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the belly dancing lola maria felix this is just one of several love triangles in french cancan true to stereotype these french showbiz folk are always falling in loverenoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie gabin perfectly incarnates the aging french playboy hero arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously usedfrench cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation the actor who plays him philippe clay is fun to watch a really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortionsthe movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together the dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in moulin rouge in fact if i have one complaint about french cancan its that the whole thing is a little too technicolor even when nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy its just that i cant help thinking that things werent ever this colorful and innocent in real life,positive
i cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film i was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless on the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse ben g fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in dorothy s fans should stick to galaxina peter b fans should stick to last picture show and target fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to peter bs amazingly awful book killing of the unicorn,negative

this one is considered a key pre code film from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story but also the paranoid sci fi invasion usa and features one of barbara stanwycks best early rolesshes supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day george brent douglass dumbrille edward van sloan nat pendleton and john wayne at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout in the former category and in the latter robert barrat as stanwycks father donald cook as her most tragic conquest alphonse ethier as her elderly mentor more on this later arthur hohl as a lecherous politician and henry kolker as cooks boss and father in law whom stanwyck also seduces curiously scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censorsabetted by crackling ie typically hard boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small town heroine by the intellectual ethier stanwyck complains to him early on that shes no ball of fire which of course contradicts her later comedy directed by howard hawks and co starring gary cooper of that name under ethiers auspices she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm shes eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one relating to an ambitious statesmans lust for power in sergei eisensteins october sociologically its also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid companionthe first two thirds of the film are simply terrific at first i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly introduced george brent character while he ignores her but just like the others hes soon under her spell on second viewing however this aspect felt less jarring as its evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused and that her tenure in paris has softened her even if she tries to cling to her hard earned wealth for as long as its possiblereleased on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume collection the film is presented in two strikingly different edits a recently unearthed pre release version and the tamer theatrical release print among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwycks life as a tramp from the age of though its heard in the accompanying trailer while many other scenes have been shortened ie censored for content the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances the seduction at the railroad car the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook the shooting followed by a suicide only shots are heard in the shorter version stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing again only brent appears in the version released to theaters etc tha latter then utilizes alternate takes for some scenes and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version however we also get an obviously tacked on happy ending the pre release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open ended note and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which basically has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche,positive
first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere however ill rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version i found this movie excruciatingly dull all the movies atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie im sorry but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy i didnt see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie maybe i missed something but i have to tell it like i see it i rated it a what can i say us oriented tastes maybe,negative
tony curtis and skip homier both are wearing black with white trim canvas shoes in the scenes just before and after the swimming pond and the tank being blown up must have been too hard on the young stars feetif the real marines had been on the mission they would have been wearing boots in the first scenes they took off their leggins just before starting out on their little trip to find the farmer when they went to the area where they dug the fox holes tony and skip are wearing combat boots then later when lovejoy and curtis run into the framer and his daughter tony is wearing the tennis shoes but hey have been blacken the movie in about a true story but did they really need the love interest,negative
i thought maybe maybe this could be good an early appearance by the re animator jeffery combs many homages to old horror movies the troma label on the front this movie could be a gem i thought wrongfrightmare is a boring overplayed half assed homage to the fright films of yore the story is an old one young people breaking into a house getting drunk making love and tampering with things that shouldnt be tampered with the oft recycled slasher film formula is used here this time with a thought to be dead actor named conrad radzoff doing the killing in fact the performance by the radzoffs actor ferdy mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film he does the snooty dracula style character very well but as for the kids its not so good with combs only having a minimal partthe film lacks entertainment value and only features one cool character and one or two scenes that can hold your attention i do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch and this is the only movie left at blockbuster,negative
killer tomatoes movies have this special kind of humor you either love it or hate it i personally like it but in this fourth movie the feeling is gone the tomatoes arent the same jokes are lame even the actors arent as funny because thats the only thing this kind of movies are supposed to be funnyso now following the plot made to laugh is annoying they really shouldnt have done the fourth part to the killer tomatoes trilogy,negative
this movies origins are a mystery to me as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it i assume that before starship troopers killshot was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network cable or otherwise the new title of kill shot is comically thrown into the opening sequence the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema the quick cuts cheesy melrose place music and short second close up candid shots of the main actors let you know what youre in forand i dont mind at all i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers an excellent book in my opinion not so hot a movie but thats another review after looking it up on imdb my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career see bond girl and wild things references here they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r rated status coveted in suspense video rental sections that is in any event they should have left it unrated if youre trying to sell it in the suspense softcore porn sectionall in all its entertaining i hate to spoil the fun of telling you its a tv pilot though that was the biggest pull while watching it when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show the differences between them make themselves more clear than usualwould i rent it again no would i watch this tv show well why not its better than baywatch and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid s token black guy whos gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter racial dating token asian japanese i assume from the name koji more adept at science and computers than talking to women beautiful intelligent latina pre med student who has everything going for her except her familys bank account this show probably would have done okbut as a movie it just cracks mei gave it a out of considering what it was and what it was forced to become it made for a very enjoyable evening and thats all i ask of rentals,positive
this movie will promote the improvement of the mind read a book its incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make ive seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented i didnt think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into knights high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind my roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off now that has to really tell you something if you watch this movie and like it i will pray for you,negative
for daniel auteuil queen margot was much better for nastassja kinski paris texas was much better the biggest disappointments were from chris menges crisscross and a world apart cannot even be compared with this one and goran bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from queen margot for this movie attention to the end of the film if this was an american pop movie i would not feel surprised at all but for a european film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple minded and disappointing there are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people there are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone and finally there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys every character is shown in simple black and white terms the good versus the evil plus from the very beginning i could understand how the story would end is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse i believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie i think this movie was not disturbing but very disappointing,negative
a different look at horror the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting however from my american perspective this movie just wasnt that good the protagonist marie played by anastasia hille wasnt a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film then a long time passed before any real suspense built up once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else the concept was more original than most direct to video movies and they didnt use sex to make up for a thin plot all in all id recommend it for renting but not for theater goers,negative
this so called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of dangerous liasons the plots are identical as is most of the script i loved the book its based off of and i loved the first movie but im not even going to bother with the rd movie the pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal andi just cant stress how bad the movie was if you dont want to take my word for it just watch it and youll see what i mean if youve read a review that says that if you likes the first one youll like the second one the only reason that is is because it is the exact same movie although the plot is not even as good they took so many lines from the first movie its hard to tell which movie youre watching,negative
i went into this movie with high hopes normally im not too picky about my movies and creature movies are always fun to watch or so i thought ill list the good parts of this movie the creature effects all of the creatures were well done their movements were realistic and they fit into the other imagery well to be honest the creature effects were the only reason i gave this movie a rather than a now the bad things the acting good lord ive seen bad acting but this movie takes the cake not a single one of the characters is even close to believable its like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try outs from it i tried very hard not to giggle too loud cause i didnt wanna upset anyone else in the theatre but the acting really was that bad the storyline the entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish you can pick at least plot holes out of any given minutes of film the plot holes of course are complimentary with the cheese this is probably one of the most clichéd not thought out and outright dumbest stories ive ever seen put on screen since i had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching parasite on the scifi channel the dialogue this is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can at every chance they possibly can in this world it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least other low budget creature movies it is the world of cheese and cliché the special effects while the creature effects were downright awesome the special effects fail miserably yes they are better than those seen in other movies but a lot of it is in the presentation and this movie has no presentation whatsoever it looks kinda like the special effects used on the power rangers tv show to be honest to sum up dragon wars is worth neither your time nor your money the concept is good but it is trapped in the bad directing acting dialogue and cheesiness of the film wait til the next big monster movie comes out its gotta be better than this cause dragon wars is absolutely horrible,negative
the unpleasant home invasion genre can be traced back to wes cravens early sleazefest last house on the left with such nasty off shoots as i spit on your grave wrong way and the visitors soon following in the footsteps of that film here in this early s italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train la ragazza del vagone letto known in english speaking countries as terror express starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspensedavid phil and ernie three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others board a trans continental express in italy the train is full of other passengers among them prostitute juliette silvia dionisio who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment the three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive drunken behaviour but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train pretty soon they are revelling in their temporary control a young wife zora kerova is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a year old virgin travelling with her parents a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game the only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to germany but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs la ragazza del vagone letto gets off to a decent start various intriguing characters are introduced and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutter level of its genre things fall apart during a horrid scene in which kerova is sex sandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs the scene is gloatingly filmed and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators instead we are being asked to feel turned on this is sensationalism at its worst further humiliating rapes follow but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia one sequence featuring the year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly wrong by the end of la ragazza del vagone letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense lovers of sleaze will revel in it others might want to look elsewhere,negative
the final film for ernst lubitsch completed by otto preminger after lubitschs untimely death during production is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume dramatics in a th century castle in southeastern europe a countess falls for her sworn enemy the leader of the hungarian revolt shes aided by her ancestor whose painted image magically comes to life betty grable in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant unfortunately this script by samson raphaelson taken from an operetta by rudolf schanzer and e welisch is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh or entertain the results are good looking but unabsorbing from,negative
dad and i both had a good time watching the flick today for a guy primarily known for serious roles de niro is a heckuva comic actor of course it helps to have his past film images to play against consider that one of those roles minutes was a cop having to deal with the interference of the mass media and you have an interesting set of compare contrast performancesmurphy plays another of his axel foley sort of characters shatner plays a burlesque of himself a parallel world self who was best known for tj hooker and not star trekits interesting to watch how the film comments on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictional counterparts in tv and film shatner lectures on the proper means of sliding across a car hood de niro points out holsters scratch the hood finish ironically as the film progresses de niros character begins to incorporate the illusions of tv cop reality into the real world case hes workingthe film draws its inspiration from a gamut of sources so one could make the comment it is derivative well so what satire needs to derive its humor in order to exist and besides the film does have quirky moments of originality for example im reasonably sure the method of the villains death has never been done before one quibble about the reality of the weapons involved shouldnt those guns have had some kind of recoil in order to penetrate steel those bullets had to have enough inertia to penetrate and any bullets highest level of inertia is at the moment of firing so firing a volley of these tank killer bullets should have driven the shooters back onto their butts oh what the heck its a satire maybe the guns lack of recoil is itself a satire on the b f guns used so casually in thrillers,positive
its hard for me to assign the fair number of stars to this film but i settled on because of its high production values and what was in an innovative approach to the war film remember too that i havent seen it since but it did make a strong impressionthe long days dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves there is no preaching no sentimentality no comic relief no complicated scenariosunfortunately theres no subtlety either partly because of their situation trying to stay alive the characters come across as flat familiar clichés as entertainment the film doesnt make it though it was clearly not intended to entertain it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan both of which are far more watchable films here the flat and generally disagreeable characters the lack of an actual plot and the realistically unpleasant images including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history make the film hard to sit through though it is only minutesso stars for production and realism stars for the feeling youll have when its over a bonus star for having its heart in the right place average like carl foremans underrated the victors an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film the long days dying seems not to be on dvd why not both films have been on cable a number of times,positive
this is what movies should aspire to funny without being totally stupid a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs biting without resorting to f bombs every line ive been seeing justin long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years i figured with the right role he could break out mac commercials not withstanding this film just might put him on a fast track to the a list the rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly this is an excellent little film with a nice message but you dont need to buy the message to have a good time lewis black is as usual hilarious and blake lively is a fresh faced beauty take a couple hours and see this film they will not have been wasted,positive
the warmest most engaging movie of its genre those lips those eyes made me smile and cry as it reminded me of the work it takes to pursue a dream and the pain of disappointment hulce and langella are superb and the story seems to write itself a brilliant screenplay by david shaber one of my favorites see the warriors and nighthawks for more and beautiful sets filmed on location i think at the actual summer theater in which the story takes place you cant see this movie and not want to drop everything and get into the theater please check this video out if you can find it,positive
corridors of time the movie you can watch if youre looking for a sophisticated way of suicide some use guns ropes or gas but you want to ruin your brains do not wait any longer corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes thinking christian clavier is able to act and to bring you fun i do not miss the francs this poor thing cost me sometimes one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero this film deserves a but thats only because i like jean reno too bad for him he also stars in ronin i think im gonna dislike him,negative
shame really very rarely do i watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end ive seen quite a few of ira levins adaptations rosemarys baby and the stepford wives and liked both them but this just didnt appeal to mewhen i read the plot outline an award winning playwright michael caine decides to murder one of his former pupils christopher reeve and steel his script for his own success i was excited i like thrillers michael caines a good actor sidney lumets a good director and ira levins work is generally goodi wont spoil it for anyone who hasnt seen it yet but all id say is there are loads of twists and turns so many its kind of hard to explain the films plot line in detail without giving it away i enjoyed the first minutes before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out though i have to give lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loudthe main cast michael caine christopher reeve dyan cannon and irene worth were all brilliant in their roles though worths obvious fake russian accent got on my nerves slightly nothing personal irene i think any actors fake accent would irritate me not sure if cannons character was meant to be annoyingly funny but dyan managed to annoy and amuse at the same timeanyone reading this i dont want you to be put off watching this because of my views give it a chance you may like it you may not its all about opinion,negative
i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie however this was an unique case this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted needless to say i was brutally disappointed set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing first there are gaping plot holes second very few of the c list i dont even dare call them b actors can act worth a damn so any scenes that have potential fail miserably third the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult leading to very few surprises for the audience fourth and most importantly the ending is completely anti climatic partially because of how it ends setting who the killer turns out to be and partially because the dialog is just atrocious to the films credit it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene and ive seen a lotso just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no you really dont as you run in the opposite direction,negative
why was this film made what were the creators of this thinking the first mm film at least had a plot that made sense and was potentially interesting the first film was about the snuff film industry this sequel is about hold on the porno industry yes as if the snuff film industry an industry in which people are supposedly killed on film for entertainment were at all in the same league with the adult film industry an industry in which people film other people engaging in unstimulated sex acts and situations for eroticism the idea alone should warn you about how poorly conceived the idea for this film alone is it isnt helped by a lack of plot character acting direction script logic theme or even sound design this is a remarkably boring film that never once held my attention literally nothing works why would a mystery thriller film about the porno industry involving assassination and betrayal work anyway i dont have much of an interest in adult films but i certainly have watched them before why would somebody make a film about the evils of it and that they would make it in a sequel to a film about snuff movies i dont even know if there is an industry involved in snuff film making but i hope it doesnt the idea of a snuff film alone is horrific and only people who are truly sick and bad would be a part of it i dont think that the adult film industry revolves around murder and torture im pretty sure that a lot of people make pornographic films for good intentions rather than to hurt and kill people it is never okay to hurt another human being the adult film industry isnt about hurting people its about creating films that are to me a diversion and a waste of time what is this film trying to say it doesnt work,negative
i read a few reviews of the movie and got the impression that it was not as good as the previous karate kid installments although my favorite is still karate kid ii i felt this fourth installment of the movie series was consistent with the others and had some important lessons to share unlike the previous versions the karate student is a female teenager who takes a somewhat different learning path rather than a male teenager maggi finds this a little more challenging but rises to the occasion the plot twists are believable and predictable i found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees the camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time the zen monastery is both austere and charming the zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow i liked the zen bowling scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious zen archery scene earlier on the quality level of the movie is like a good tv series the music chosen for the background is very good especially with the little river band playing listen to your heart the lessons in the movie are valuable and worthwhile to learn they feel faithful to the spirit of karate and take care not to over glorify the fighting part all in all i enjoyed it,positive
i cant believe i bought this movie on dvd i dont even remember it being shown on tv last year why in the world couldnt they have just done a real sequel to one of the best christmas movies ever made damn and randy quaid looks like hes been on the same drugs as jerry lewis i didnt know about this movie until i bought it tonight and thought i would check it out on imdb and see how it was rated boy did i make a mistake if your reading this review be warned stay away from it and just stick to the first christmas vacation well at least i didnt pay more then bucks for it maybe i can trade it in and get half of that back at tower records then again maybe not ps i still havent watched it yet my dvd player went on the fritz tonight watching another wonderful movie the chronicles of riddick unrated directors cut woo freaking hoo,negative
ive commented once on this chucky great but i had to do it again to say some things about the film when i first saw it in a great balcony in a great theater the film was a lot of fun in the theater and my first chucky film ever in a theater and that was a special moment for me because i cherish chucky the other horror villains are referenced with great coolness and the gore was shockingly great the scene where the gay kid gets nailed by the truck was amazingly cheerful that was a great gore scene and the ending was so bizarre and shocking it made me s my pants the idea of having the seed of chucky was very very bizarre and shocking when i left the theater i just loved it and i couldnt believe it was real the bizarre and different qualities of this childs play installment for some reason made me mark it as the jason goes to hell of the childs play series it just had that intensely shocking bizarre and different quality that reminded me of jason goes to hell a sure out of heres how i rank the series i loved it but not quite as much as tom hollands original childs play classic i cant wait for seed of chucky bring it on,positive
wow i think the overall average rating of this film on this site is incredibly low theres really no reason to dislike this film michael is a simple but fairly original and easily enjoyable romantic comedy the plot involves a group of reporters experts going to examine the mysterious appearance of an angel john travolta in the midwest the angel proves to be less saintly and more worldly than we would expect and thats what makes it entertaining his interest in women and the beatles takes a new spin on the angel thing the romantic side of this film involves michael the angel trying to get andie macdowell and william hurt together the two of them may not have the all time greatest on screen chemistry but they certainly have enough to make it work well everyone who has rated this film so low a come on the film is not that bad in fact i found it quite funny and memorable sure its not the best thing youll ever see but its still good this is a film i feel has been remarkably underrated its fun romantic and recommended by me out of,positive

i was extremely amused to read some of the bad reviews on this movie first many have said that they have taken their year old daughters and granddaughters to see this and they did not enjoy it first i dont believe that this is a kids movie at least not a movie for very very young children not at least it has very subtle humor but it is not meant to offer quick amusement as seen in tom and jerry or something like this many people have also complained that it goes very very slowlyi guess those people are all used to quantity over quality while i have a small quality problem myself with this movie and that is that the movie was not as detail oriented as the short movies i still believe that it managed quite well for a full feature film and how can people complain about the jokes the jokes were sensible timely and well thought out never rude insulting or in your face wallace is extremely smart yet cautious and grommit is the most adorable smart and cute character that could be this was a beautiful movie and the theme was very appropriatefor adults that isespecially with the increase of obesity and metabolic disease in the world theres nothing wrong with promoting vegetables and fruits for onceand this was accomplished in a very tasteful manner in that while people are concerned with the aspect of vegetables that doesnt necessarily mean that the are healthier or that they eat more of thembut just that they temper with nature which is in fact what caused the legend of the were rabbit to come true and for those out there that complained about the religious jokes i saycame on are you for real many villages revolve around the local church and legends premonitions etc are normal themes no harm done this movie was absolutely amazing yet some people had negative comments on it and i find this absolutely absurd,positive
this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout only to lose it in a robbery the story details stewarts pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film the rifle changes hands time after time as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry a great cast supports stewart here namely stephen mcnally dan duryea millard mitchell john mcintire and jay c flippen shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure tony curtis and rock hudson teen heartthrobs in later years have brief but good roles,positive
while the soundtrack is a bit dated this story is more relevant in the us now more than ever with not only blue collar jobs but everyones jobs being outsourced by us corporations while the government profits and american sufferpeter strauss is emory a steel worker who works the same job his father did for years his wife is well portrayed by pamela reed who is very realistic trying to support the family with two children when emory loses his job the mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement but there is also embezzlement and cheaper wages where they can pay one steelworker in one month outsourcing what they would have to pay strauss emory in a day never mind that these men are all good loyal workers who have values and try the best for their familyjohn goodman gary cole as strauss brother and a few other co workers are also affected it is very disturbing and realistic some scenes between emory and his father are moving emory hopes his local union will be able to re open the mill as they promise to do soemorys brother lee already sees the writing on the wall there are no jobs left in the rust belt ohio and they must move on however where in the us can they move to where will it be better for a blue collar steel workerthere is a triumphant scene at the end where emory and his crew fill the loading dock with steel products the guard allows them to do this as a final gesture one of the men committed suicide and he has empathyoverall a good message film about hard times right here in america something that few care to face until personally affected,positive
i saw this movie just recently and i said to myself this movie is bad william shatner is a great actor but he is no director its not just that the acting is bad its terrible and instead of a plot we have a very bad storyline that is called a plot what i really thought was bad was at the beginning where kirk and mccoy were teaching spock how to sing row row row your boatdo i have something against william shatner i do not but when it comes to being a director he sucks this film is not one of the worst movies i have ever seen but it is the worst of the star trek series i noticed that after this shatner did not return to direct another film in the series they apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened overall this movie sucks,negative

considering the lack of art with in african cinema or black american cinema the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking the genre is unique and not the typical expectation it is almost this departure which first catches the eye so watching it twice is critical the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinemaand it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare the film doesnt copy to attain its message it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes not racial but character based stereotypes from a writers perspective the film is brilliant it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development it must be remember this film is less than minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended but considering the director owen alik shahadahs last venture years later music is to be expected but from a theme point of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff,positive
i was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama both parts when it originally aired on masterpiece theatre i loved it but lost it then one day while going through old tapes found it again i recorded it to dvd and watched and wow i still love it the leads are excellent and my only complaint is i wish we had seen more kester what a man and prue shes so strong and wonderful living in a time and age where her affliction and how she deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil even her own brother tells prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her sigh unfortunately my copy is not the greatest with wear and tear over the years and i too would absolutely love to own this on professional dvd if it ever happens,positive
i saw this film at the palm springs international film festival i went in with the assumption that if it stars chiwetel ejiofor and hilary swank it had to be at least decent well after a kind of a slow start i was far from disappointed in fact i was quite pleased with the final producti must admit the afrikaaner and xhosa accented english of some of the actors were kind of hard to understand but like seeing waking ned devine trainspotting or any other film with heavy accented actors i adjusted after about minutes and i was trying to figure out why hilary swank was supposed to be south african and sounded like she was trying to put on an accent but sounded very american as if she was making a weak attempt at putting on the accent but later in the film as more is revealed about her character and how she moved to the us as a teen you begin to understand how she might have lost some or most of her accent so it began to make sense that only certain words might have a afrikaaner lilt to themi know its a little weak for one to use film as education but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see a dramatization of a truth and reconciliation trial id heard about the t and r process in south africa after the fall of apartheid but i didnt really know how it workedthe final verdict is that although some of the scenes felt a little contrived this was overall a very strong film the closing sequence where the truth comes out was the strong finish every film hopes for a definite must see for anyone who cares about what happens outside their borders,positive

i couldnt wait for the end this is absolutely the worst film i have ever seen if you thought that just about anyone could make a watchable movie these folks prove that there is a minimum skill set required this is a film with no redeeming features whatsoever it scores a zero in every department this is more than just amateur as the audience is given no consideration or regard at all there is no serious attempt to act or entertain the storyline is aimless pointless and senseless the cast look very uncomfortable and completely lack direction the technical aspects of the film are pooras a dvd it makes a good drinks coaster,negative
naach a more detailed review can be obtained anywhere else in the web this one is a good portrayal although i do not agree with it entirely taran is a commercial guy and hence views from his angle onlyram gopal varma rgv seems like a political party has created a marvel in rangeela so this one seems like a pale reflection of that one in some parts im not even going to compare urmila and anthara both are good the former has better acting talent although the latter is catching up nicelyanyways i like antharas character she is true to her art not touched by any unnecessary emotion and definitely not too practical she is a dance scientist actually she is so sure of her theories that even comparing her to a scientist would offend her hey donald trump maybe you gotta ditch melania here is anthara and youve already built a taj mahal aint this easy abhishek on the other hand is a practical fellow who wants money power fame etc hence these two albeit were struggling to get a break into the film industry cannot get along given their different styles and approach to life this is very typical but what i like about the movie is that it says what an abhimaan would say in its total runtime in one scene whats new this movie takes a different angle to the film industry and how different people get into it there is always something different about rgvs movies this one is different too it is way too slow for his standards in parts it drags one almost to sleepnoticeable it is tough to notice anything other than anthara in the first half of the movie i think this skin show was necessary for the dance sequences involved also looks like anthara is a pro in yoga she is way too flexible almost like a prabhu devi aby baby is improving as an actor with every movie i am sure his filmstar blood is paying off rich dividends the title song was really good the music overall was above average,negative
if you think piano teacher erika kohut isabelle huppert in michael hanekes film la pianiste is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement perversion and darkness ive got news for you the piano teacher in elfriede jellineks novel la pianiste on which the film was based is twice as repulsive disgusting deranged and even more fascinating though there cant be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that isabelle huppert has reached here above all other mortal actresses in activity today and who else could have played this character with such emotional power complete with the best piano playing dubbing an actor could deliverin the novel as in the film there are two big antagonists to the heroine kohut her own mother wonderful wreck voiced annie girardot in a part originally intended for jeanne moreau and austria itself the mother personifies jellineks perception of her native austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist fascist or at least authoritarian behavior sexual and emotional repression and lets say übermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdownla pianiste also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one you think you love we tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves which may turn out to be a huge embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake here kohut learns the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of waysit must be mentioned that elfriede jellinek is one of the best known and praised authors in austria and europe well now shes got a nobel prize and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother the novel also includes long passages about kohuts childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now haneke chose to hide this information in the film forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way dont we all know a erika kohut out there but he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film unbearable honesty to the point where most secretive horrendous feelings painfully emerge envy cruelty violence jealousy hate misery sadism masochism selfishness perversion etc all of them unmistakably humani thought la pianiste was a deeply moving film very disturbing and thought provoking with a handful of unforgettable scenes and thats just all i ask of movies it also made me buy and be thrilled by the book discover a fantastic author i hadnt read before and listen again and again to schubert so my thanks to haneke jellinek and isabelle on the other hand if youre looking for light entertainment please stay away my vote out of,positive
this movie was just horrendous how could anybody like this movie and for the ones who liked it because of the jokes they should really take a long hard look in the mirror and ask themselves if stereotypes are not bad ignoring the face of the racial stereotypes this was just awful it never had its moments if it paid homage to s airplane it needs to pay some more awful acting terrible script writing even for a movie with monique or tom arnold this movie was bad from the beginning but people might have seen the whole thing by the thought that the plane would crash one of the worse movies ever stay away,negative
this kid is rather bad but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn no he is not so much a brat as he is a kid with severe emotional problems a nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not through in a bizarre michael richards character and the always annoying gilbert gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there i actually prefer the sequel to this film as i like the fact they brought amy yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too the plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort not sure about this character at first i thought it was supposed to be his real father or something not all that good but i will pick this ahead of that culkin kid any day of the week,negative
any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf cant promise much as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was yrs ago well i was there and it just wasnt like that ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you cant show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits each kibbutz had its own problems but hardly any kibbutz had all of them the views of israel were great i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek valley yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasnt all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too,negative
after seeing this film for the rd time now i think it is almost adams worst film punch drunk love is poor in comparison to this i must say at the end when dickie gets thrown of the boat it is so funny the hair is different to his and i like it when he flips everyone off this film should only be brought if your a true adam sandler fanthe characters are poor in comparison to his funny films like the waterboy which has the same people in it peter dante who is one of the assassins trying to kill the australian birdthis film lack depth and a decent story line and deserves to be in the bottom,positive
this could have been great the voice overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a t one small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same the same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size it looks kind of odd to see a really big guest stars voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here if i am not mistaken kathy griffin did a voice over for this show and it looked too odd to be funnythere is a few other problems one being the family plot the simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into here we get too much annoying diversions like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off as you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the simpsons or even more married with childrenif i should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is its repetitiveness peter griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others lois should have been named lois lame because she is sort of one dimensional seth green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the showso what more can i say there isnt exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the simpsons has done for almost two decades,negative
i hate films about sports i guess the pre fabricated hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year what i am trying to say is that there isnt much creativity in this genre use exhibit a the game plan as evidence of this if you want so needless to say i was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element but at the same time i couldnt wait because i love surfing documentaries like step into liquid and billabong odyssey i took a step i plunged into the unknown and to be honest at first i wasnt happy i didnt like the direction the people or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs with my first viewing i thought that history couldnt be fully recorded so i thought stacy peralta was splicing stock footage with faux actors acting like they were from the late s the music was intense it matched well peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment but the visuals were anything but stimulating the elongated scenes while using amazing music to support just seemed flushed and too long for my attention i wanted to get to know the pioneers not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool i wanted a combination of who these kids were where they went during their rise of fame and where they are now it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day i wanted to know the men behind the mythsthen with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt i watched the film again with peraltas audio commentary his passion his voice his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow ed me this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today what they are still doing and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera he hadnt seen many of them in years so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface he was sincere he was sympathetic yet he showed so much dedication to this project while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do ie the sean penn mess up is not punk rock he revitalized this film for me it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thoughtjay adams tony alva jeff ho peggy oki wentzle ruml these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned and continually praised if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees while tony hawks name sells products it is these guys these mild mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport sure others were probably doing it in the stone ages but these guys did it with style grace and moved it to the next level this was a hobby for them but it also propelled them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for dogtown and z boys is the story of evolution being in the right place at the right time living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted and about friendship we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity and this is definitely a story that should be added to that i cannot say that i loved this film nor will i but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend it was sad it was emotional and these guys arent multi millionaires over again they are people with a passion and very rarely do you see that in documentariesoverall i cannot watch this film again but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time i think the downfall for this film to me was the filming the attempts to be avant garde with the style which ultimately drew away from the characters and events as mentioned before there were some elements that dragged on too much which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now peralta obviously had a passion for this sport for the people but he seemed out of focus at times the music was intense and worked perfectly with the film sean penn while he was decent with his voice over wasnt needed at all they could have spent the money elsewhere on the positive the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing peraltas voice instead of penns brings a stronger human element to the scene while he tells us better stories of the people places and events watch this film but dont expect to be blown away listen to the audio commentary i think you will be impressedgrade out of,positive

the comment by eliz hits the proverbial nail on the head for this turkey of a program but it is a hoot to watch william shatner cavort and dance yes the marks on the word dance are necessary for what bill does this show would be a great skit on snl or mad tv and it does rate a few stars for one viewing or so to see shatner who seems to have taken camp to new heights whether in a role or as himself but the guy is funnythe girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls will be pretty much out of luck when this turkey is canceled unless there is a revival of the whiskey a go go genre with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once morei watched the first contestant who was annoying and literally dumber than a post yet through sheer luck walked away with a quarter mil or so the second contestant somewhat more intelligent but whod be lucky to gain on jeopardy got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question which he didnt know and thereby left with zilchthis plethora of game shows which dangle and sometimes award large sums to everyday individuals are admittedly a cheap effort overall to attempt to woo viewers even if the host is well compensated and they give away six figures in an average episode i suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable since you dont have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures per episode with some big residual deals as wellbut i suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long this one has already pretty much reached this point i think his offerings especially with james spader and the others on boston legal should give us a satisfying quantity of bill shatners offeringsagain the above rating is simply appropriate to view bill hoot and prance perhaps one time that should be sufficient,negative
once again disney manages to make a childrens movie which totally ignores its background about the only thing common with this and the original gadget cartoons is the names the most glaring errors are the characters penny does not have her book brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop dr claw is more a show off than an evil villain etc but there are more than that the horrors start from the first minutes of the film having gadget as a security guard called john brown doesnt help identifying him as the classic inspector gadget and right in the beginning we see disneys blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman they introduce brenda who only serves to make this movie disney compatible add to this the fact that the claw seen in this film and the classic dr claw are almost diagonally opposite and youll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline what would help would be a better storyline to replace it but as you guessed disney failed in that too the whole movie is just gadget acting silly for sillinesss sake and lusting after brenda as if to add insult to the injury disney introduced the new gadgetmobile it doesnt look function or think like the old gadgetmobile at all its just the canonical comic relief figure disney obviously recognised that the gadget cartoons were a comedy so they made the film a comedy too but they took out all the clever running gags like the assignment paper exploding in the chiefs face and replaced them with gadget being a moron the gadgetmobile being a wise ass and claw showing off someone should tell disney that childrens movie doesnt imply total lack of any brain usage gadget should be targeted for children of years not children of months like this movie whatever this movie is supposed to be it is not repeat not the real inspector gadget because i love the old gadget i hate this,negative
obsession comes in many flavors and exists for a variety of reasons for some it may be nothing more than a compulsive disorder but for others it may be an avenue of survival lack of nurturing combined with an inability to negotiate even the simplest necessities of daily life or the basic social requirements may compel even a genius to enthusiastically embrace that which provides a personal comfort zone and in extreme cases the object of that satisfaction may become a manifested obsession driving that individual on until what began as a means of survival becomes the very impetus of his undoing and as we discover in the luzhin defence directed by marleen gorris a high level of intelligence will not insure a satisfactory resolution to the problem and in fact may actually exacerbate the situation obsession it seems has no prejudice or preference moreover it gives no quarter at an italian resort in the s alexander luzhin john turturro is one of many who have gathered there for a chess tournament the winner of which will be the world champion luzhin is a master of the game but he is vulnerable in that chess has long since ceased to be a game to him rather it is his obsession that one thing discovered in childhood that saw him though his total ineptness in seemingly all areas of life and enabled him to cope with the subtle disenfranchisements of his immediate family so luzhin is a genius with an achilles heel a flaw which perhaps only one other person knows about and understands and furthermore realizes can be exploited for his own personal gain at this very tournament that man is valentinov stuart wilson luzhins former mentor who after an absence of some years has suddenly reappeared and made himself known to luzhin valentinov is an unwelcomed disconcerting presence to luzhin and once again life threatens to overwhelm him not only is he about to face a formidable opponent in the tournament turati fabio sartor against whom in a previous match he emerged with a draw after fourteen hours but he is also attempting to resolve a new element in his life his feelings for a young woman hes just met at the resort natalia emily watson and genius though he may be dark clouds are gathering above him that just may push luzhin even deeper into the obsession that has been the saving grace as well the curse of his entire life to tell luzhins story gorris effectively uses flashbacks to gradually reveal the elements of his childhood that very quickly led to his obsession with chess and as his background is established it affords the insights that allow the audience to more fully understand who luzhin is and how he got to this point in his life for the scenes of his childhood gorris textures them with an appropriately dark atmosphere and a subtle sense of foreboding that carries on into and underlies the present more pastoral setting of the resort the transitions through which she weaves the past together with the present are nicely handled and with the pace gorris sets it makes for a riveting yet unrushed presentation that works extremely well she also underplays the menace produced by the presence of valentinov concentrating on the drama rather than the suspense which ultimately serves to heighten the overall impact of the film making luzhins tragedy all the more believable and unsettling the single element that makes this film so memorable however is the affecting performance of john turturro for this film to work luzhin must be absolutely believable one false or feigned moment would be disastrous as it would take the viewer out of the story immediately it doesnt happen however and the film does work because the luzhin turturro creates is impeccably honest and true to life he captures luzhins genius as well as his inadequacies and presents his character in terms that are exceptionally telling and very real its a performance equal to if not surpassing geoffrey rushs portrayal of david helfgott in shine and when you compare his work here with other characters hes created from sid lidz in unstrung heroes to pete in o brother where art thou to al fountain in box of moonlight you realize what an incredible range turturro has as an actor and what a remarkable artist he truly is as natalia emily watson is excellent as well turning in a fairly reserved performance through which she develops and presents her character quite nicely though she has to be somewhat outgoing to relate to luzhin watson manages to do it in an introspective way that is entirely effective most importantly because of the detail she brings to her performance it makes her accelerated relationship with luzhin believable and lends total credibility to the story you have but to look into watsons eyes to know that the feelings shes conveying are real its a terrific bit of work from a talented and gifted actor the supporting cast includes geraldine james vera christopher thompson stassard peter blythe ilya orla brady anna mark tandy luzhins father kelly hunter luzhins mother alexander hunting young luzhin and luigi petrucci santucci well crafted and delivered the luzhin defence is an emotionally involving film presented with a restrained compassion that evokes a sense of sorrow and perhaps a reflection upon mans inhumanity to man we dont need a movie of course to tell us that there is cruelty in the world but we are well served by the medium of the cinema when it reminds us of something we should never forget inasmuch as we all have the ability to effect positive change and to make a difference in the lives of those around us i rate this one,positive
terrible movie just terrible the start of this movie is like something out of a bad women in prison movie then it moves on to being a b movie version of aliens b movie in this case meaning the addition of gratuitous sex scenes and women in lingerie oh and a lot of the footage is the exact same as used in two other movies by the same company including the women in prison schtick the only thing saving this movie from a is that i have actually seen worse movies not many and not much but worse,negative
this movie is difficult to watch in our fast paced culture of the st century but it is worth it for the messages that it conveys chiefly the consequences and ramifications of technology upon society specifically when that technology is used for warfarethis movie presents a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization as influenced by the advent of technology and the subsequent deconstruction of civilization and therefore serves as a cautionary tale against the misuse of technology but as the circle completes itself familiar themes and sentiments pop up again to present self serving rather than self destructive ways that humanity may utilize technologybrilliant for its time the picture and sound quality may pose a challenge for some but as a landmark in the history development and evolution of the sci fi genre it is a must in the end free will and free choice are once again posed to humanity as a means for controlling our own destiny rather than having it served to us by someone else or indeed the state ofsociety itself as shaped by world eventsthose who are downtrodden by what life throws their way sometimes tend to remain so but yet there is always a glimmer of hope and continuity that remains as this film positsas far as qualifying as sci fi one of the biggest common demoninators of that genre is its speculative nature it asks us the questions what if these events happened this way and what effect would it have on society or the individuals within it how would we reactas far as influence this film projects those speculative sciences that make sci fi as unique as it is and keeps us asking those important questions,positive
i like jane austin novels i love pride and prejudice and sense and sensibility books and movies and im half way through mansfield park but i couldnt stand emma i gave up on the book after chapters and by the end of the movie i couldnt care less about emma she didnt seem to change at all maybe it was paltrows acting which as excellent in seen or my lack of interest for the movie dunno the costumes are nice but the dancing was clumsy compared to pride and prejudice dancing by colin firth and jennifer ehlei gave it a basically for the fact knightly is bloody gorgeous and although it as a rather patchy performance for ewan mcgregor i liked his singing,negative
i have watched this movie on dvd a couple of times nowthe first time i watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour an engrossing entertaining film thank god no kiera knightley in it refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of queen victoria and the difficult choices she had to make nothing bad about the movie at all no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as conroy and lord melbourne,positive
i saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years needless to say the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic but still alec guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly if formulaic romp through industrial post wwii englandthis is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product remember the car that runs on water remember the promise of nuclear energy in this case its a fabric that doesnt wear out wrinkle or even get dirty of course fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business and so the plot gets a bit thickguiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast those brits always the stiff upper lip when under fire the film might chug along exactly like guinesss goofy invention but its a good ride all the same,positive

i disagree with anyone who donet like this movie i used to love this movie when i was little and i still do its sweet funny and warms your heart and it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed and even though it didnt have much of a story it was still excellent i give it a and two thumbs up oh yeah and it proves that your deepest wishs and dreams can come true tear teari love this movie personally if anyone says it sucked than i will say shame on you because it was a delightful little movie and im glad that at least some people liked it,positive
overall the movie heart of darkness was pitiful compared to the book anyone who has ever read the book and had a sufficient understanding of it would be able to see the countless obvious flaws there is an immeasurable difference between the two it seems to me that the director was walking into a losing battle i couldnt imagine that someone would take on the monstrous task of recreating heart of darkness the immense detail and magic of the story would be impossible to justly interpret conrads story had so many layers and so much depth that it would seem pointless to try to make a visual interpretationfirst capturing the details of the story is unattainable the colossal fine points created by joseph conrad cannot be rightfully recreated through film marlows feelings and emotions cannot be equally construed in the movie if you have taken on the enormous task of tackling conrads work then you know as well as i that conrad only wrote half the story the additional half is a series of connections made by the reader you as the reader are required to be capable of inferring and connecting joseph conrads ideas as a result several crucial details are absent in the moviealso although the movie was an adequate length the film seemed short it seemed that conrad was able to pack many more details into pages than the movie could pack in an hour and a half the speed of the movie kept the viewer from getting to know the characters marlow was much more of a stranger the viewpoint of the book puts you into marlows shoes however in the movie youre almost watching marlow from a distance i began to think that the director was trying to utilize the same read between the lines method as conrad did however the connections were weak i know that if i had not read the book then i would in no way be able to begin to understand the depth of the situation and the charactersfinally kurtz also seemed to be interpreted incorrectly his role was short and the details werent all included it was impossible to comprehend the true kurtz in the length of time he was shown an important detail in the book was that kurtz had become a god to the africans i didnt think that significant detail was defined also in the book kurtz represented a soulless being he had died inside long ago i believe the director comprehended this detail however instead of recreating it he just had kurtz mope around and mumble everything moreover it seemed like the director attempted to make kurtz seem mysterious however instead he seemed entirely unidentifiedaltogether this movie reminded me of a teenager cramming to finish a science project due the next day it appeared to have been crafted effortlessly and in hardly any time the characters were alienated crucial details were left out and overall the central plot was lost in translation,negative
the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they dont because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his womanthat peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara hershey coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired its not something hes proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhuntlest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when hes on coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities cant touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal thencoburns gang includes morgan paull thalmus rasulala john quade larry wilcox and jorge rivero heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to bethe last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and im thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence of which there is a lot for a little peckinpaugh lite the last hard men is your film,positive
i was wondering what possessed the organizers of the victoria film festival to include this film in their program i guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film i on the other hand consider it the worst film i have ever seen it starts with a bad script full of holes and dialog so unlikely its embarrassing ideas are introduced then dropped with no development the acting left me totally cold and uninvolved the set decoration was appropriate for the time but a decorators nightmare the only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly the attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years the photography was leaden and lacking in variety save your money for something worthwhile,negative
the unlikely duo of zero mostel and harry belafonte team up to give us some interesting performances and subject matter in the angel levine its one interesting twist on the themes from its a wonderful lifezero is married to ida kaminsky and the two of them belong to a special class of elderly jewish poor in new york mostel used to be a tailor and proud of his trade but his back and arthritis have prevented him from working kaminsky is mostly bedridden hes reduced to applying for welfare in desperation like jimmy stewart he cries out to god for some helpnow maybe if he had gotten someone like henry travers things might have worked out differently but even stewart had trouble accepting travers but travers had one thing going for him he was over years off this mortal coil and all his ties to earthly things were gone god sent mostel something quite different the recently deceased harry belafonte who should have at least been given some basic training for angels before being given an assignmentbelafonte hasnt accepted hes moved on from life hes still got a lot of issues he also has a wife gloria foster who doesnt know hes passed on hit by a car right at the beginning of the film you put his issues and mostels issues and youve got a good conflict starting with the fact that mostel cant believe in a black jew named levinethis was the farewell performance for polish jewish actress ida kaminsky who got a nomination for best actress in the shop on main street a few years back the other prominent role here is that of irish actor milo oshea playing a nice jewish doctor remembering osheas brogue from the verdict i was really surprised to see and hear him carry off the part of the doctorthe angel levine raises some interesting and disturbing questions about faith and race in this society its brought to you by a stellar cast and of course created by acclaimed writer bernard malamud make sure to catch it when broadcast,positive
back when musicals werent showcases for choreographers we had wonderful movies such as this onebeing a big fan of both wodehouse and fred astaire i was delighted to finally see this movie not quite a blend of wodehouse and hollywood but close enough some of the american vaudeville humour the slapstick not the witty banter clash with wodehouses british sense of humour but on the whole the american style banter makes the american characters seem real rather than cardboard caricaturessome inventive staging for the dance numbers including the wonderful fairground with revolving floors and funhouse mirrors more than make up for the lack of a busby berkley over the top dance number they seem a lot more realistic if you could ever imagine people starting to sing and dance as realisticthe lack of ginger rogers and eric blore dont hurt the movie instead they allow different character dynamics to emerge its also nice not to have a wise cracking headstrong love interest instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest far more in keeping with wodehouses young aristocratic females,positive
slaughter high is intrinsically your emblematic s slasher flick a prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt a few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errorsthe acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect though it doesnt help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable the lead carol manning caroline munro is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and shes the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for not to mention the geeky guy is almost too geeky and i think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his so when he gets mauled does anyone really care there is much unintentional laughter potential munros lack of acting talent is quite apparent which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast however the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose munro who is in her mid s at the time as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers and then when it comes to later life and munro is playing around her real age the rest of the cast do not pass as adults this all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking ill get you with that being said slaughter high really isnt a very good slasher flick but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans but dont expect dilemma suspense or any credibility from it horrible,negative

it makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from hollywood because oftentimes in hollywood its all just a popularity contest it also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content yet this film is overrated and overblown eddie murphy looks just ridiculous no way do jeniffer hudson and beyonce knowles give the oscar rated performance so many have raved over before the film was even out i cant even believe that condon is being set up to be nominated for a directing oscar when all he did was put together an album glitz does not replace a nothing storyline a bunch of songs does not a movie make,negative
in short this movie is completely worthlessthe idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early s might think of the future an interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flopsapparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed but as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening the color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality and i dont understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking if anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics they dont measure up even to the ancient jurassic park graphics the models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling there were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island but they are not explained in any waythe story is horrible beyond belief in fact i cant believe i didnt just walk out of this movie the relationship between polly and joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception why is the morris paley character even there we are not in any way convinced that joe is heroic i mean he flies a plane and saved one person polly for personal reasons yeah theres a great hero for you dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about joe wanting to save him who were the nepalease that locked joe and polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire totenkopf operation was roboticplot holes why did bai lings character a major fall from her excellent character in the crow halt the robots who had captured joe they were looking for the vials and had not found them why in the hell would dex be captured but not killed he doesnt have or know about the vials and the bad guys didnt know that polly had the vials and was connected to joe and therefore to dex polly indicates that they dont know anything about totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete fbi style file on him the blank spot on the map as described by the nepalese if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot at one point polly and joe have to give up their clothes they are burned joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly polly has her original clothes backsigh how far off am i supposed to switch my brain to watch this crapwe are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screenand the acting were supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad british accents which character isnt annoying i think ling bais dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesnt have a single line the dialogue wasnt camp and doesnt even rise to the level of cheese its just bad and annoying these people arent heros or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real lifei cant believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on imdb imho it should be competing with batman forever in the bottom of all time,negative
it is ironic that during the s when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal he was virtually ignored by the critics he is now seen however as a director of formidable intellect who achieved his best work in melodrama written on the wind is about the downfall of a texan oil dynasty surrounded by worthless reputation alcoholism and nymphomania it is about the twisted fatal connections between sex power and moneystack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration arrogance jealousy insanity and some deep insecurities dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual appetites degrading herself for hudson and to other fellows in town her best line im filthy in one frantic scene we see her shaking quivering and sweating to a provocative mambo in another weeping alone over a model oil derrick at her fathers desksymbol of excessive wealth and masculine tyranny the frenetic atmosphere is both made palatable and intensified by sirks magnificent use of colors lights and careful use of mirrors,positive

the key to the year old virgin is not merely that andy stitzer is a year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters the year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesnt use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiositycarell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show castmember uses the concept of the film to expand his character we get to understand why andy is the way he is its the little things that make this film work when andys co worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he signals his turns he doesnt just adorn his home with action figures he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldnt even begin to focus on all of these thingsthe plot is fairly simplistic andys co worker pals find out hes never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman its a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenilityandys friends are a complement to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay romany malco is a womanizing ladies man and cal seth rogen is a tattooed sexaholic their attempts at getting andy in the sack backfire numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimisticfinally andy meets single mom trish played by catherine keener and much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers arent worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days trish being unaware that andy is still a virginthe year old virgin was directed by judd apatow the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and geeks apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script co written by carell offers plentyhowever in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the year old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film its easy to understand why we like andy we care about him hes not just some cardboard cutout sex comedy cliché hes a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish naivety his friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet it strikes a chord with the audiencealthough this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesnt offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen the best sex comedies work this way from risky business to american pie and that is the major difference between something like the year old virgin and days and nights,positive

understand im reviewing the film i have seen i realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film thus neutering it completely when seeing names like ginger lynn and jenna jameson attached i knew i wasnt going to get a horror classic but at the very least i expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed but no this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film i mean its easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes but they suddenly cut away or the scene just totally ends right as it begins how does one screw up cannibals and porn stars i mean thats a winning formula it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executives wife or something because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this reading about it a few years back in fangoria i was excited it looked like a fun film but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled evil breed hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday as i think a good movie exists in this mess but until then best grab a twelve pack of bud cause thats the only way youll make it through this movie,negative

the lady in question starring gene wilder is a well acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black and white raymond burr perry mason series both perry and cash kept me guessing right up to the end there were many suspects with a motive for the murder but i had no idea which character it would begene wilder has a special charming wit about him even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well im sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie even his singing was a delight i like him in this role more than his former sillier roles like the young frankenstein and willy wonka i am hoping a e will continue this series they ought to call it something like the a e gene wilder mysteriesthe music fit the period i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script to me that always distractsoverall my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well crafted start in what we hope will be many others just like one of our other favorites raymond burrs perry mason,positive
cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value michael curtiz at his best lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the philo vance series william powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best a forerunner to the thin man series recommend to everyone did you figure it all out,positive
with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy comebacks with about two good actors among many wanna bes this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood wannabe ditto of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that theyd probably be more lenient so the acting wasnt five star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the junction of characters and the end relationships were also too mushy and clichéd for me spare yourself and rent something better,negative
a particularly maligned example of italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot if anything the alternate the mark of satan is even less relevant to the plot this hybrid of gothic horror and giallo with a strong dose of erotica only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful here we get the usual group of people an acting troupe stranded on an island to which they were invited by a count since he had become enamored of the leading lady a dead ringer for his missing spouse the characters are pretty much stereotypes middle aged but dashing hero played by giacomo rossi stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy demure heroine sluttish companion recalling mae west and emerging the most annoying of the lot a meek but devoted stage manager forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior a couple of lesbians a mysterious gardener the ubiquitous luciano pigozzi who for once gets in on the action if you know what i mean an envious housekeeper nominal star femi benussi though for what it is worth this is really an ensemble piece a religious fanatic of a butler an impressionable chambermaid etc while the film is not by any means unwatchable the atrocious dubbing snails pace shoddy production with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black and white film and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half hour do not help matters besides marcello giombinis score though pleasant in itself comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances that said the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one considering there is surely no shortage of suspects here,negative
it used to be my thinking that movies required plots or some other means of making you care at all about the story line or anything that is going on this movie has showed me that you dont actually have to have anything like thati could sum it up simply as that but imdb wants me to have more lines it was kind of pretty not compelling in the slightest the way the characters talk in the movie makes you think it should have taken place over a matter of days but there is no passage of time and im pretty sure it all happens in an hourif you are looking to entertain yourself then buy a gallon of milk and see how fast you can drink it before throwing up it would be a far better use of your time time that you will never get back jurassic park was pulled off better than this movie,negative
this movie was on the pay channels today and i had nothing to do so i had it on this has to be the worst football movie ever made this has to be one of the worst movies period the premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave stars out of this movie isnt even a half a star bad acting scott bakula sinks as usual larry miller sinbad couldnt act if he tried rob schneiders one liners completely stunk fred thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie the only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see kathy ireland nude in the shower not even close a complete waste of time and of film if we could give a negative number minus,negative
this movie is a disgrace how can you take one of the greatest science fiction stories of all time and turn it into some kind of half assed love story the entire beginning of the movie was not in the hg wells story and didnt need to be also the eloi were done completely wrong they did build houses or form any kind of real society they didnt care about each other at all that was an important part of the story the way they had formed a world that was without hardship or complex emotions they were barely even aware of the morlocks i dont know why this movie was made the way it was but some stories should be told as they are or left alone,negative
skip all the subjective this is a great film reviews and read the imdb trailer or the back the kino videobox which includes both versions of this flick which ill paraphrase to the tune of sci fi score by george antheil the camera goes on a sleepwalk through b movie hell all photographed by will thompson who did plan from outer space maniac you dont know whether to laugh at the film or with it so if you like self produced b or c grade noir wannabe actors and effects with pretensions of surrealism this could be for you otherwise get a copy of screamplay a modern low budget expressionist masterpiece,negative
if it is true that sadomasochism is a two sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites then the cinematic portrait of erika kohut has its reality professor kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself her outward expression projects her desire that is why she can hurt without guilt or remorsealong comes talented charming handsome young walter klemmer benoit magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity he wants to become her student so as to be close to her she rejects him out of hand but because of his talent the vienna conservatory votes him in he falls in love with her again she pushes him away but he will not take no for an answer and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self respectthe question the viewer might ask at this point is who is in control the sadist or the masochist indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist it is hard to tell is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment or is it the person who is rushing out the door sated giving the order that no one is to know what happenedbut erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak she is a sex extreme freak she wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability actually that isnt even true she says she doesnt care what others think she doesnt care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love love she calls it for her sex and love are one and the sameat one point walter tells her that love isnt everything how ironic such a superfluity is to her how gratuitous the commentthe movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by michael haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find erika within he also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another this is particularly important in the scene in which erika like a blood drained corpse caught in stark white and black light lies under her lover rigid as stone here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery we dont need to see any morethe part of erika kohut is perfect for isabelle huppert who is not afraid of extremes indeed she excels in them i have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense what matters to her is the performance and the challenge no part is too demanding no character too depraved its as if huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to watch her as she does she is always fascinating and nearly flawless she is not merely a leading light of the french cinema she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of worki think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in the lacemaker la dentellire from when she was years old there she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing pomme a parisian apprentice hairdresser her character was shy about sex and modest just an ordinary french girl who hoped one day to be a beautician here she is a self destructive witch bitter with hateful knowledge of herself shameless and entirely depravedhuppert is fortunate in being an actress in france where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets hollywood could never make a movie like this in the american cinema only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in la cérémonie in which she plays a vile spiteful murderessdo see this for isabelle huppert you wont forget her or the character she brings to life,positive
an unmarried woman named stella bette midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man stephen collins he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own things go ok until the child named jenny trini alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worseive seen both the silent version and sound version of stella dallas neither one affected me much and i cry easily but they were well made if dated trying to remake this in was just a stupid idea i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of beaches to get this made this predictably bombed the story is laughable and dated by todays standards even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end stephen collins and marsha mason both good actors dont help in supporting roles flimsy and dull really who thought this would work see the stanwyck version instead i give this a,negative
i starred as eugene morris jerome in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesnt live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon i know this play backwards and forwards and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off the production was cheesy the changes in the plays script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie adaptation the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said the other characters were off key as well a general disappointment messy disloyal to the play amateurishly executed,negative
