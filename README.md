# ðŸŽ¬ Multilingual Movie Reviews NLP Pipeline

This project builds an end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** to analyze movie reviews in **English** and **Spanish**, performing:
- Text Cleaning & Tokenization  
- POS Tagging & Parsing  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Sentiment Analysis (Positive/Negative Classification)

The project is modular, fully reproducible, and runs on a small sampled dataset (2K reviews total).

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Languages** | English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ & Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ |
| **Dataset** | 1K English + 1K Spanish movie reviews (balanced positive/negative) |
| **Goal** | Detect sentiment and extract named entities |
| **Libraries Used** | `pandas`, `spaCy`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` |
| **Pipeline Entry** | `run_pipeline.py` |

## ðŸ“š Dataset Information

The original datasets are sourced from **Kaggle** and have been legally sampled for academic use:

1. **English Dataset:**  
   *IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews* â€” includes labeled positive and negative reviews.

2. **Spanish Dataset:**  
   *IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews (Spanish Translation)* â€” machine-translated and labeled for sentiment.  
   ðŸ”— https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisdiegofv97/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews-spanish/data

Each dataset was reduced to **1,000 randomly sampled reviews per language** to ensure balanced sentiment distribution and faster model training.
